<h1 class="chapter" id="Invocation-1">12 Invocation</h1>   <p id="index-command-line">Most often when you use the C preprocessor you do not have to invoke it explicitly: the C compiler does so automatically. However, the preprocessor is sometimes useful on its own. You can invoke the preprocessor either with the <code>cpp</code> command, or via <code>gcc -E</code>. In GCC, the preprocessor is actually integrated with the compiler rather than a separate program, and both of these commands invoke GCC and tell it to stop after the preprocessing phase. </p> <p>The <code>cpp</code> options listed here are also accepted by <code>gcc</code> and have the same meaning. Likewise the <code>cpp</code> command accepts all the usual <code>gcc</code> driver options, although those pertaining to compilation phases after preprocessing are ignored. </p> <p>Only options specific to preprocessing behavior are documented here. Refer to the GCC manual for full documentation of other driver options. </p> <p>The <code>cpp</code> command expects two file names as arguments, <var>infile</var> and <var>outfile</var>. The preprocessor reads <var>infile</var> together with any other files it specifies with ‘<samp>#include</samp>’. All the output generated by the combined input files is written in <var>outfile</var>. </p> <p>Either <var>infile</var> or <var>outfile</var> may be <samp>-</samp>, which as <var>infile</var> means to read from standard input and as <var>outfile</var> means to write to standard output. If either file is omitted, it means the same as if <samp>-</samp> had been specified for that file. You can also use the <samp>-o <var>outfile</var></samp> option to specify the output file. </p> <p>Unless otherwise noted, or the option ends in ‘<samp>=</samp>’, all options which take an argument may have that argument appear either immediately after the option, or with a space between option and argument: <samp>-Ifoo</samp> and <samp>-I foo</samp> have the same effect. </p>   <p id="index-options_002c-grouping">Many options have multi-letter names; therefore multiple single-letter options may <em>not</em> be grouped: <samp>-dM</samp> is very different from ‘<samp><span class="nolinebreak">-d</span> <span class="nolinebreak">-M</span></samp>’. </p>  <dl compact id="index-options"> <dt><code>-D <var>name</var></code></dt> <dd> <p id="index-D">Predefine <var>name</var> as a macro, with definition <code>1</code>. </p> </dd> <dt><code>-D <var>name</var>=<var>definition</var></code></dt> <dd>
<p>The contents of <var>definition</var> are tokenized and processed as if they appeared during translation phase three in a ‘<samp>#define</samp>’ directive. In particular, the definition is truncated by embedded newline characters. </p> <p>If you are invoking the preprocessor from a shell or shell-like program you may need to use the shell’s quoting syntax to protect characters such as spaces that have a meaning in the shell syntax. </p> <p>If you wish to define a function-like macro on the command line, write its argument list with surrounding parentheses before the equals sign (if any). Parentheses are meaningful to most shells, so you should quote the option. With <code>sh</code> and <code>csh</code>, <samp>-D'<var>name</var>(<var>args…</var>)=<var>definition</var>'</samp> works. </p> <p><samp>-D</samp> and <samp>-U</samp> options are processed in the order they are given on the command line. All <samp>-imacros <var>file</var></samp> and <samp>-include <var>file</var></samp> options are processed after all <samp>-D</samp> and <samp>-U</samp> options. </p> </dd> <dt><code>-U <var>name</var></code></dt> <dd> <p id="index-U">Cancel any previous definition of <var>name</var>, either built in or provided with a <samp>-D</samp> option. </p> </dd> <dt><code>-include <var>file</var></code></dt> <dd> <p id="index-include">Process <var>file</var> as if <code>#include "file"</code> appeared as the first line of the primary source file. However, the first directory searched for <var>file</var> is the preprocessor’s working directory <em>instead of</em> the directory containing the main source file. If not found there, it is searched for in the remainder of the <code>#include "…"</code> search chain as normal. </p> <p>If multiple <samp>-include</samp> options are given, the files are included in the order they appear on the command line. </p> </dd> <dt><code>-imacros <var>file</var></code></dt> <dd> <p id="index-imacros">Exactly like <samp>-include</samp>, except that any output produced by scanning <var>file</var> is thrown away. Macros it defines remain defined. This allows you to acquire all the macros from a header without also processing its declarations. </p> <p>All files specified by <samp>-imacros</samp> are processed before all files specified by <samp>-include</samp>. </p> </dd> <dt><code>-undef</code></dt> <dd> <p id="index-undef">Do not predefine any system-specific or GCC-specific macros. The standard predefined macros remain defined. See <a href="standard-predefined-macros#Standard-Predefined-Macros">Standard Predefined Macros</a>. </p> </dd> <dt><code>-pthread</code></dt> <dd> <p id="index-pthread">Define additional macros required for using the POSIX threads library. You should use this option consistently for both compilation and linking. This option is supported on GNU/Linux targets, most other Unix derivatives, and also on x86 Cygwin and MinGW targets. </p> </dd> <dt><code>-M</code></dt> <dd>   <p id="index-dependencies_002c-make">Instead of outputting the result of preprocessing, output a rule suitable for <code>make</code> describing the dependencies of the main source file. The preprocessor outputs one <code>make</code> rule containing the object file name for that source file, a colon, and the names of all the included files, including those coming from <samp>-include</samp> or <samp>-imacros</samp> command-line options. </p> <p>Unless specified explicitly (with <samp>-MT</samp> or <samp>-MQ</samp>), the object file name consists of the name of the source file with any suffix replaced with object file suffix and with any leading directory parts removed. If there are many included files then the rule is split into several lines using ‘<samp>\</samp>’-newline. The rule has no commands. </p> <p>This option does not suppress the preprocessor’s debug output, such as <samp>-dM</samp>. To avoid mixing such debug output with the dependency rules you should explicitly specify the dependency output file with <samp>-MF</samp>, or use an environment variable like <code>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</code> (see <a href="environment-variables#Environment-Variables">Environment Variables</a>). Debug output is still sent to the regular output stream as normal. </p> <p>Passing <samp>-M</samp> to the driver implies <samp>-E</samp>, and suppresses warnings with an implicit <samp>-w</samp>. </p> </dd> <dt><code>-MM</code></dt> <dd id="dashMF"> <p id="index-MM">Like <samp>-M</samp> but do not mention header files that are found in system header directories, nor header files that are included, directly or indirectly, from such a header. </p> <p>This implies that the choice of angle brackets or double quotes in an ‘<samp>#include</samp>’ directive does not in itself determine whether that header appears in <samp>-MM</samp> dependency output. </p> </dd> <dt><code>-MF <var>file</var></code></dt> <dd> <p id="index-MF">When used with <samp>-M</samp> or <samp>-MM</samp>, specifies a file to write the dependencies to. If no <samp>-MF</samp> switch is given the preprocessor sends the rules to the same place it would send preprocessed output. </p> <p>When used with the driver options <samp>-MD</samp> or <samp>-MMD</samp>, <samp>-MF</samp> overrides the default dependency output file. </p> <p>If <var>file</var> is <samp>-</samp>, then the dependencies are written to <samp>stdout</samp>. </p> </dd> <dt><code>-MG</code></dt> <dd> <p id="index-MG">In conjunction with an option such as <samp>-M</samp> requesting dependency generation, <samp>-MG</samp> assumes missing header files are generated files and adds them to the dependency list without raising an error. The dependency filename is taken directly from the <code>#include</code> directive without prepending any path. <samp>-MG</samp> also suppresses preprocessed output, as a missing header file renders this useless. </p> <p>This feature is used in automatic updating of makefiles. </p> </dd> <dt><code>-MP</code></dt> <dd> <p id="index-MP">This option instructs CPP to add a phony target for each dependency other than the main file, causing each to depend on nothing. These dummy rules work around errors <code>make</code> gives if you remove header files without updating the <samp>Makefile</samp> to match. </p> <p>This is typical output: </p> <div class="smallexample"> <pre class="smallexample" data-language="cpp">test.o: test.c test.h

test.h:</pre>
</div> </dd> <dt><code>-MT <var>target</var></code></dt> <dd> <p id="index-MT">Change the target of the rule emitted by dependency generation. By default CPP takes the name of the main input file, deletes any directory components and any file suffix such as ‘<samp>.c</samp>’, and appends the platform’s usual object suffix. The result is the target. </p> <p>An <samp>-MT</samp> option sets the target to be exactly the string you specify. If you want multiple targets, you can specify them as a single argument to <samp>-MT</samp>, or use multiple <samp>-MT</samp> options. </p> <p>For example, <code>-MT '$(objpfx)foo.o'</code> might give </p> <div class="smallexample"> <pre class="smallexample" data-language="cpp">$(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c</pre>
</div> </dd> <dt><code>-MQ <var>target</var></code></dt> <dd> <p id="index-MQ">Same as <samp>-MT</samp>, but it quotes any characters which are special to Make. <code>-MQ '$(objpfx)foo.o'</code> gives </p> <div class="smallexample"> <pre class="smallexample" data-language="cpp">$$(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c</pre>
</div> <p>The default target is automatically quoted, as if it were given with <samp>-MQ</samp>. </p> </dd> <dt><code>-MD</code></dt> <dd> <p id="index-MD"><samp>-MD</samp> is equivalent to <samp>-M -MF <var>file</var></samp>, except that <samp>-E</samp> is not implied. The driver determines <var>file</var> based on whether an <samp>-o</samp> option is given. If it is, the driver uses its argument but with a suffix of <samp>.d</samp>, otherwise it takes the name of the input file, removes any directory components and suffix, and applies a <samp>.d</samp> suffix. </p> <p>If <samp>-MD</samp> is used in conjunction with <samp>-E</samp>, any <samp>-o</samp> switch is understood to specify the dependency output file (see <a href="#dashMF">-MF</a>), but if used without <samp>-E</samp>, each <samp>-o</samp> is understood to specify a target object file. </p> <p>Since <samp>-E</samp> is not implied, <samp>-MD</samp> can be used to generate a dependency output file as a side effect of the compilation process. </p> </dd> <dt><code>-MMD</code></dt> <dd> <p id="index-MMD">Like <samp>-MD</samp> except mention only user header files, not system header files. </p> </dd> <dt><code>-fpreprocessed</code></dt> <dd> <p id="index-fpreprocessed">Indicate to the preprocessor that the input file has already been preprocessed. This suppresses things like macro expansion, trigraph conversion, escaped newline splicing, and processing of most directives. The preprocessor still recognizes and removes comments, so that you can pass a file preprocessed with <samp>-C</samp> to the compiler without problems. In this mode the integrated preprocessor is little more than a tokenizer for the front ends. </p> <p><samp>-fpreprocessed</samp> is implicit if the input file has one of the extensions ‘<samp>.i</samp>’, ‘<samp>.ii</samp>’ or ‘<samp>.mi</samp>’. These are the extensions that GCC uses for preprocessed files created by <samp>-save-temps</samp>. </p> </dd> <dt><code>-fdirectives-only</code></dt> <dd> <p id="index-fdirectives_002donly">When preprocessing, handle directives, but do not expand macros. </p> <p>The option’s behavior depends on the <samp>-E</samp> and <samp>-fpreprocessed</samp> options. </p> <p>With <samp>-E</samp>, preprocessing is limited to the handling of directives such as <code>#define</code>, <code>#ifdef</code>, and <code>#error</code>. Other preprocessor operations, such as macro expansion and trigraph conversion are not performed. In addition, the <samp>-dD</samp> option is implicitly enabled. </p> <p>With <samp>-fpreprocessed</samp>, predefinition of command line and most builtin macros is disabled. Macros such as <code>__LINE__</code>, which are contextually dependent, are handled normally. This enables compilation of files previously preprocessed with <code>-E -fdirectives-only</code>. </p> <p>With both <samp>-E</samp> and <samp>-fpreprocessed</samp>, the rules for <samp>-fpreprocessed</samp> take precedence. This enables full preprocessing of files previously preprocessed with <code>-E -fdirectives-only</code>. </p> </dd> <dt><code>-fdollars-in-identifiers</code></dt> <dd> <p id="fdollars_002din_002didentifiers">Accept ‘<samp>$</samp>’ in identifiers.

This allows the compiler to emit diagnostic about the current macro expansion stack when a compilation error occurs in a macro expansion. Using this option makes the preprocessor and the compiler consume more memory. The <var>level</var> parameter can be used to choose the level of precision of token location tracking thus decreasing the memory consumption if necessary. Value ‘<samp>0</samp>’ of <var>level</var> de-activates this option. Value ‘<samp>1</samp>’ tracks tokens locations in a degraded mode for the sake of minimal memory overhead. In this mode all tokens resulting from the expansion of an argument of a function-like macro have the same location. Value ‘<samp>2</samp>’ tracks tokens locations completely. This value is the most memory hungry. When this option is given no argument, the default parameter value is ‘<samp>2</samp>’. </p> <p>Note that <code>-ftrack-macro-expansion=2</code> is activated by default. </p> </dd> <dt><code>-fmacro-prefix-map=<var>old</var>=<var>new</var></code></dt> <dd> <p id="index-fmacro_002dprefix_002dmap">When preprocessing files residing in directory <samp><var>old</var></samp>, expand the <code>__FILE__</code> and <code>__BASE_FILE__</code> macros as if the files resided in directory <samp><var>new</var></samp> instead. This can be used to change an absolute path to a relative path by using <samp>.</samp> for <var>new</var> which can result in more reproducible builds that are location independent. This option also affects <code>__builtin_FILE()</code> during compilation. See also <samp>-ffile-prefix-map</samp>. </p> </dd> <dt><code>-fexec-charset=<var>charset</var></code></dt> <dd>  <p id="index-character-set_002c-execution">Set the execution character set, used for string and character constants.

When this option is enabled, the preprocessor emits, after the initial linemarker, a second linemarker with the current working directory followed by two slashes. GCC uses this directory, when it’s present in the preprocessed input, as the directory emitted as the current working directory in some debugging information formats. This option is implicitly enabled if debugging information is enabled, but this can be inhibited with the negated form <samp>-fno-working-directory</samp>. If the <samp>-P</samp> flag is present in the command line, this option has no effect, since no <code>#line</code> directives are emitted whatsoever. </p> </dd> <dt><code>-A <var>predicate</var>=<var>answer</var></code></dt> <dd> <p id="index-A">Make an assertion with the predicate <var>predicate</var> and answer <var>answer</var>.

All comments are passed through to the output file, except for comments in processed directives, which are deleted along with the directive. </p> <p>You should be prepared for side effects when using <samp>-C</samp>; it causes the preprocessor to treat comments as tokens in their own right. For example, comments appearing at the start of what would be a directive line have the effect of turning that line into an ordinary source line, since the first token on the line is no longer a ‘<samp>#</samp>’. </p> </dd> <dt><code>-CC</code></dt> <dd> <p id="index-CC">Do not discard comments, including during macro expansion. This is like <samp>-C</samp>, except that comments contained within macros are also passed through to the output file where the macro is expanded. </p> <p>In addition to the side effects of the <samp>-C</samp> option, the <samp>-CC</samp> option causes all C++-style comments inside a macro to be converted to C-style comments. This is to prevent later use of that macro from inadvertently commenting out the remainder of the source line. </p> <p>The <samp>-CC</samp> option is generally used to support lint comments. </p> </dd> <dt><code>-P</code></dt> <dd id="index-C-language_002c-traditional"> <p id="index-P">Inhibit generation of linemarkers in the output from the preprocessor. This might be useful when running the preprocessor on something that is not C code, and will be sent to a program which might be confused by the linemarkers.

<li> For the quote form of the include directive, the directories specified by <samp>-iquote</samp> options are searched in left-to-right order, as they appear on the command line. </li>

The directory is still searched but as a system directory at its normal position in the system include chain. This is to ensure that GCC’s procedure to fix buggy system headers and the ordering for the <code>#include_next</code> directive are not inadvertently changed. If you really need to change the search order for system directories, use the <samp>-nostdinc</samp> and/or <samp>-isystem</samp> options.
