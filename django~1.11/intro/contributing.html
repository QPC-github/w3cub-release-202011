Maybe you’ve found a bug in Django that you’d like to see fixed, or maybe there’s a small feature you want added.</p> <p>Contributing back to Django itself is the best way to see your own concerns addressed. This may seem daunting at first, but it’s really pretty simple. We’ll walk you through the entire process, so you can learn by example.</p>  <h3 id="who-s-this-tutorial-for">Who’s this tutorial for?</h3> <div class="admonition seealso" id="s-who-s-this-tutorial-for"> <p class="first admonition-title">See also</p> <p class="last">If you are looking for a reference on how to submit patches, see the <a class="reference internal" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/internals/contributing/writing-code/submitting-patches/"><span class="doc">Submitting patches</span></a> documentation.</p> </div> <p>For this tutorial, we expect that you have at least a basic understanding of how Django works. This means you should be comfortable going through the existing tutorials on <a class="reference internal" href="tutorial01"><span class="doc">writing your first Django app</span></a>. In addition, you should have a good understanding of Python itself. But if you don’t, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.diveintopython3.net/">Dive Into Python</a> is a fantastic (and free) online book for beginning Python programmers.</p> <p>Those of you who are unfamiliar with version control systems and Trac will find that this tutorial and its links include just enough information to get started. However, you’ll probably want to read some more about these different tools if you plan on contributing to Django regularly.</p> <p>For the most part though, this tutorial tries to explain as much as possible, so that it can be of use to the widest audience.</p> <div class="admonition-where-to-get-help admonition"> <p class="first admonition-title">Where to get help:</p> <p class="last">If you’re having trouble going through this tutorial, please post a message to <a class="reference internal" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/internals/mailing-lists/#django-developers-mailing-list"><span class="std std-ref">django-developers</span></a> or drop by <a class="reference external" href="irc://irc.freenode.net/django-dev">#django-dev on irc.freenode.net</a> to chat with other Django users who might be able to help.</p> </div>   <h3 id="what-does-this-tutorial-cover">What does this tutorial cover?</h3> <p id="s-what-does-this-tutorial-cover">We’ll be walking you through contributing a patch to Django for the first time. By the end of this tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of both the tools and the processes involved. Specifically, we’ll be covering the following:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>Installing Git.</li> <li>How to download a development copy of Django.</li> <li>Running Django’s test suite.</li> <li>Writing a test for your patch.</li> <li>Writing the code for your patch.</li> <li>Testing your patch.</li> <li>Submitting a pull request.</li> <li>Where to look for more information.</li> </ul> <p>Once you’re done with the tutorial, you can look through the rest of <a class="reference internal" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/internals/contributing/index/"><span class="doc">Django’s documentation on contributing</span></a>. It contains lots of great information and is a must read for anyone who’d like to become a regular contributor to Django. If you’ve got questions, it’s probably got the answers.</p> <div class="admonition-python-3-required admonition"> <p class="first admonition-title">Python 3 required!</p> <p class="last">This tutorial assumes you are using Python 3. Get the latest version at <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python’s download page</a> or with your operating system’s package manager.</p> </div> <div class="admonition-for-windows-users admonition"> <p class="first admonition-title">For Windows users</p> <p class="last">When installing Python on Windows, make sure you check the option “Add python.exe to Path”, so that it is always available on the command line.</p> </div>    <h2 id="code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</h2> <p id="s-code-of-conduct">As a contributor, you can help us keep the Django community open and inclusive. Please read and follow our <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>.</p>   <h2 id="installing-git">Installing Git</h2> <p id="s-installing-git">For this tutorial, you’ll need Git installed to download the current development version of Django and to generate patch files for the changes you make.</p> <p>To check whether or not you have Git installed, enter <code>git</code> into the command line. If you get messages saying that this command could not be found, you’ll have to download and install it, see <a class="reference external" href="https://git-scm.com/download">Git’s download page</a>.</p> <div class="admonition-for-windows-users admonition"> <p class="first admonition-title">For Windows users</p> <p class="last">When installing Git on Windows, it is recommended that you pick the “Git Bash” option so that Git runs in its own shell. This tutorial assumes that’s how you have installed it.</p> </div> <p>If you’re not that familiar with Git, you can always find out more about its commands (once it’s installed) by typing <code>git help</code> into the command line.</p>   <h2 id="getting-a-copy-of-django-s-development-version">Getting a copy of Django’s development version</h2> <p id="s-getting-a-copy-of-django-s-development-version">The first step to contributing to Django is to get a copy of the source code. First, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/django/django/fork">fork Django on GitHub</a>. Then, from the command line, use the <code>cd</code> command to navigate to the directory where you’ll want your local copy of Django to live.</p> <p>Download the Django source code repository using the following command:</p> <pre data-language="console">$ git clone git@github.com:YourGitHubName/django.git
</pre> <p>Now that you have a local copy of Django, you can install it just like you would install any package using <code>pip</code>. The most convenient way to do so is by using a <em>virtual environment</em> (or virtualenv) which is a feature built into Python that allows you to keep a separate directory of installed packages for each of your projects so that they don’t interfere with each other.</p> <p>It’s a good idea to keep all your virtualenvs in one place, for example in <code>.virtualenvs/</code> in your home directory. Create it if it doesn’t exist yet:</p> <pre data-language="console">$ mkdir ~/.virtualenvs
</pre> <p>Now create a new virtualenv by running:</p> <pre data-language="console">$ python3 -m venv ~/.virtualenvs/djangodev
</pre> <p>The path is where the new environment will be saved on your computer.</p> <div class="admonition-for-windows-users admonition"> <p class="first admonition-title">For Windows users</p> <p>Using the built-in <code>venv</code> module will not work if you are also using the Git Bash shell on Windows, since activation scripts are only created for the system shell (<code>.bat</code>) and PowerShell (<code>.ps1</code>). Use the <code>virtualenv</code> package instead:</p> <pre data-language="none">$ pip install virtualenv
$ virtualenv ~/.virtualenvs/djangodev
</pre> </div> <div class="admonition-for-ubuntu-users admonition"> <p class="first admonition-title">For Ubuntu users</p> <p>On some versions of Ubuntu the above command might fail. Use the <code>virtualenv</code> package instead, first making sure you have <code>pip3</code>:</p> <pre data-language="console">$ sudo apt-get install python3-pip
$ # Prefix the next command with sudo if it gives a permission denied error
$ pip3 install virtualenv
$ virtualenv --python=`which python3` ~/.virtualenvs/djangodev
</pre> </div> <p>The final step in setting up your virtualenv is to activate it:</p> <pre data-language="console">$ source ~/.virtualenvs/djangodev/bin/activate
</pre> <p>If the <code>source</code> command is not available, you can try using a dot instead:</p> <pre data-language="console">$ . ~/.virtualenvs/djangodev/bin/activate
</pre> <div class="admonition-for-windows-users admonition"> <p class="first admonition-title">For Windows users</p> <p>To activate your virtualenv on Windows, run:</p> <pre data-language="none">$ source ~/virtualenvs/djangodev/Scripts/activate
</pre> </div> <p>You have to activate the virtualenv whenever you open a new terminal window. <a class="reference external" href="https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">virtualenvwrapper</a> is a useful tool for making this more convenient.</p> <p>Anything you install through <code>pip</code> from now on will be installed in your new virtualenv, isolated from other environments and system-wide packages. Also, the name of the currently activated virtualenv is displayed on the command line to help you keep track of which one you are using. Go ahead and install the previously cloned copy of Django:</p> <pre data-language="console">$ pip install -e /path/to/your/local/clone/django/
</pre> <p>The installed version of Django is now pointing at your local copy. You will immediately see any changes you make to it, which is of great help when writing your first patch.</p>   <h2 id="rolling-back-to-a-previous-revision-of-django">Rolling back to a previous revision of Django</h2> <p id="s-rolling-back-to-a-previous-revision-of-django">For this tutorial, we’ll be using ticket <a class="reference external" href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/24788">#24788</a> as a case study, so we’ll rewind Django’s version history in git to before that ticket’s patch was applied. This will allow us to go through all of the steps involved in writing that patch from scratch, including running Django’s test suite.</p> <p><strong>Keep in mind that while we’ll be using an older revision of Django’s trunk for the purposes of the tutorial below, you should always use the current development revision of Django when working on your own patch for a ticket!</strong></p> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="first admonition-title">Note</p> <p class="last">The patch for this ticket was written by Paweł Marczewski, and it was applied to Django as <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/django/django/commit/4df7e8483b2679fc1cba3410f08960bac6f51115">commit 4df7e8483b2679fc1cba3410f08960bac6f51115</a>. Consequently, we’ll be using the revision of Django just prior to that, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/django/django/commit/4ccfc4439a7add24f8db4ef3960d02ef8ae09887">commit 4ccfc4439a7add24f8db4ef3960d02ef8ae09887</a>.</p> </div> <p>Navigate into Django’s root directory (that’s the one that contains <code>django</code>, <code>docs</code>, <code>tests</code>, <code>AUTHORS</code>, etc.). You can then check out the older revision of Django that we’ll be using in the tutorial below:</p> <pre data-language="console">$ git checkout 4ccfc4439a7add24f8db4ef3960d02ef8ae09887
</pre>   <h2 id="running-django-s-test-suite-for-the-first-time">Running Django’s test suite for the first time</h2> <p id="s-running-django-s-test-suite-for-the-first-time">When contributing to Django it’s very important that your code changes don’t introduce bugs into other areas of Django. One way to check that Django still works after you make your changes is by running Django’s test suite. If all the tests still pass, then you can be reasonably sure that your changes haven’t completely broken Django. If you’ve never run Django’s test suite before, it’s a good idea to run it once beforehand just to get familiar with what its output is supposed to look like.</p> <p>Before running the test suite, install its dependencies by first <code>cd</code>-ing into the Django <code>tests/</code> directory and then running:</p> <pre data-language="console">$ pip install -r requirements/py3.txt
</pre> <p>If you encounter an error during the installation, your system might be missing a dependency for one or more of the Python packages. Consult the failing package’s documentation or search the Web with the error message that you encounter.</p> <p>Now we are ready to run the test suite. If you’re using GNU/Linux, macOS, or some other flavor of Unix, run:</p> <pre data-language="console">$ ./runtests.py
</pre> <p>Now sit back and relax. Django’s entire test suite has over 9,600 different tests, so it can take anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes to run, depending on the speed of your computer.</p> <p>While Django’s test suite is running, you’ll see a stream of characters representing the status of each test as it’s run. <code>E</code> indicates that an error was raised during a test, and <code>F</code> indicates that a test’s assertions failed. Both of these are considered to be test failures. Meanwhile, <code>x</code> and <code>s</code> indicated expected failures and skipped tests, respectively. Dots indicate passing tests.</p> <p>Skipped tests are typically due to missing external libraries required to run the test; see <a class="reference internal" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/internals/contributing/writing-code/unit-tests/#running-unit-tests-dependencies"><span class="std std-ref">Running all the tests</span></a> for a list of dependencies and be sure to install any for tests related to the changes you are making (we won’t need any for this tutorial). Some tests are specific to a particular database backend and will be skipped if not testing with that backend. SQLite is the database backend for the default settings. To run the tests using a different backend, see <a class="reference internal" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/internals/contributing/writing-code/unit-tests/#running-unit-tests-settings"><span class="std std-ref">Using another settings module</span></a>.</p> <p>Once the tests complete, you should be greeted with a message informing you whether the test suite passed or failed. Since you haven’t yet made any changes to Django’s code, the entire test suite <strong>should</strong> pass. If you get failures or errors make sure you’ve followed all of the previous steps properly. See <a class="reference internal" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/internals/contributing/writing-code/unit-tests/#running-unit-tests"><span class="std std-ref">Running the unit tests</span></a> for more information. If you’re using Python 3.5+, there will be a couple failures related to deprecation warnings that you can ignore. These failures have since been fixed in Django.</p> <p>Note that the latest Django trunk may not always be stable. When developing against trunk, you can check <a class="reference external" href="https://djangoci.com">Django’s continuous integration builds</a> to determine if the failures are specific to your machine or if they are also present in Django’s official builds. If you click to view a particular build, you can view the “Configuration Matrix” which shows failures broken down by Python version and database backend.</p> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="first admonition-title">Note</p> <p class="last">For this tutorial and the ticket we’re working on, testing against SQLite is sufficient, however, it’s possible (and sometimes necessary) to <a class="reference internal" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/internals/contributing/writing-code/unit-tests/#running-unit-tests-settings"><span class="std std-ref">run the tests using a different database</span></a>.</p> </div>   <h2 id="creating-a-branch-for-your-patch">Creating a branch for your patch</h2> <p id="s-creating-a-branch-for-your-patch">Before making any changes, create a new branch for the ticket:</p> <pre data-language="console">$ git checkout -b ticket_24788
</pre> <p>You can choose any name that you want for the branch, “ticket_24788” is an example. All changes made in this branch will be specific to the ticket and won’t affect the main copy of the code that we cloned earlier.</p>   <h2 id="writing-some-tests-for-your-ticket">Writing some tests for your ticket</h2> <p id="s-writing-some-tests-for-your-ticket">In most cases, for a patch to be accepted into Django it has to include tests. For bug fix patches, this means writing a regression test to ensure that the bug is never reintroduced into Django later on. A regression test should be written in such a way that it will fail while the bug still exists and pass once the bug has been fixed. For patches containing new features, you’ll need to include tests which ensure that the new features are working correctly. They too should fail when the new feature is not present, and then pass once it has been implemented.</p> <p>A good way to do this is to write your new tests first, before making any changes to the code. This style of development is called <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">test-driven development</a> and can be applied to both entire projects and single patches. After writing your tests, you then run them to make sure that they do indeed fail (since you haven’t fixed that bug or added that feature yet). If your new tests don’t fail, you’ll need to fix them so that they do. After all, a regression test that passes regardless of whether a bug is present is not very helpful at preventing that bug from reoccurring down the road.</p> <p>Now for our hands-on example.</p>  <h3 id="writing-some-tests-for-ticket-24788">Writing some tests for ticket #24788</h3> <p id="s-writing-some-tests-for-ticket-24788">Ticket <a class="reference external" href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/24788">#24788</a> proposes a small feature addition: the ability to specify the class level attribute <code>prefix</code> on Form classes, so that:</p> <pre data-language="python">[…] forms which ship with apps could effectively namespace themselves such
that N overlapping form fields could be POSTed at once and resolved to the
correct form.
</pre> <p>In order to resolve this ticket, we’ll add a <code>prefix</code> attribute to the <code>BaseForm</code> class. When creating instances of this class, passing a prefix to the <code>__init__()</code> method will still set that prefix on the created instance. But not passing a prefix (or passing <code>None</code>) will use the class-level prefix. Before we make those changes though, we’re going to write a couple tests to verify that our modification functions correctly and continues to function correctly in the future.</p> <p>Navigate to Django’s <code>tests/forms_tests/tests/</code> folder and open the <code>test_forms.py</code> file. Add the following code on line 1674 right before the <code>test_forms_with_null_boolean</code> function:</p> <pre data-language="python">def test_class_prefix(self):
    # Prefix can be also specified at the class level.
    class Person(Form):
        first_name = CharField()
        prefix = 'foo'

    p = Person()
    self.assertEqual(p.prefix, 'foo')

    p = Person(prefix='bar')
    self.assertEqual(p.prefix, 'bar')
</pre> <p>This new test checks that setting a class level prefix works as expected, and that passing a <code>prefix</code> parameter when creating an instance still works too.</p> <div class="admonition-but-this-testing-thing-looks-kinda-hard admonition"> <p class="first admonition-title">But this testing thing looks kinda hard…</p> <p>If you’ve never had to deal with tests before, they can look a little hard to write at first glance. Fortunately, testing is a <em>very</em> big subject in computer programming, so there’s lots of information out there:</p> <ul class="last simple"> <li>A good first look at writing tests for Django can be found in the documentation on <a class="reference internal" href="../topics/testing/overview"><span class="doc">Writing and running tests</span></a>.</li> <li>Dive Into Python (a free online book for beginning Python developers) includes a great <a class="reference external" href="http://www.diveintopython3.net/unit-testing.html">introduction to Unit Testing</a>.</li> <li>After reading those, if you want something a little meatier to sink your teeth into, there’s always the Python <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#module-unittest" title="(in Python v3.8)"><code>unittest</code></a> documentation.</li> </ul> </div>   <h3 id="running-your-new-test">Running your new test</h3> <p id="s-running-your-new-test">Remember that we haven’t actually made any modifications to <code>BaseForm</code> yet, so our tests are going to fail.

From the command line, <code>cd</code> into the Django <code>tests/</code> directory and run:</p> <pre data-language="console">$ ./runtests.py forms_tests
</pre> <p>If the tests ran correctly, you should see one failure corresponding to the test method we added.

    The ability to specify ``prefix`` on the form class was added.
</pre> <p>Since this new feature will be in an upcoming release it is also added to the release notes for Django 1.9, on line 164 under the “Forms” section in the file <code>docs/releases/1.9.txt</code>:</p> <pre data-language="python">* A form prefix can be specified inside a form class, not only when
  instantiating a form. See :ref:`form-prefix` for details.

It covers Trac etiquette, how to claim tickets for yourself, expected coding style for patches, and many other important details.</li> <li>First time contributors should also read Django’s <a class="reference internal" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/internals/contributing/new-contributors/"><span class="doc">documentation for first time contributors</span></a>. It has lots of good advice for those of us who are new to helping out with Django.</li> <li>After those, if you’re still hungry for more information about contributing, you can always browse through the rest of <a class="reference internal" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/internals/contributing/index/"><span class="doc">Django’s documentation on contributing</span></a>. It contains a ton of useful information and should be your first source for answering any questions you might have.</li> </ul>   <h3 id="finding-your-first-real-ticket">Finding your first real ticket</h3> <p id="s-finding-your-first-real-ticket">Once you’ve looked through some of that information, you’ll be ready to go out and find a ticket of your own to write a patch for. Pay special attention to tickets with the “easy pickings” criterion. These tickets are often much simpler in nature and are great for first time contributors. Once you’re familiar with contributing to Django, you can move on to writing patches for more difficult and complicated tickets.</p> <p>If you just want to get started already (and nobody would blame you!), try taking a look at the list of <a class="reference external" href="https://code.djangoproject.com/query?status=new&amp;status=reopened&amp;has_patch=0&amp;easy=1&amp;col=id&amp;col=summary&amp;col=status&amp;col=owner&amp;col=type&amp;col=milestone&amp;order=priority">easy tickets that need patches</a> and the <a class="reference external" href="https://code.djangoproject.com/query?status=new&amp;status=reopened&amp;needs_better_patch=1&amp;easy=1&amp;col=id&amp;col=summary&amp;col=status&amp;col=owner&amp;col=type&amp;col=milestone&amp;order=priority">easy tickets that have patches which need improvement</a>. If you’re familiar with writing tests, you can also look at the list of <a class="reference external" href="https://code.djangoproject.com/query?status=new&amp;status=reopened&amp;needs_tests=1&amp;easy=1&amp;col=id&amp;col=summary&amp;col=status&amp;col=owner&amp;col=type&amp;col=milestone&amp;order=priority">easy tickets that need tests</a>. Just remember to follow the guidelines about claiming tickets that were mentioned in the link to Django’s documentation on <a class="reference internal" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/internals/contributing/writing-code/submitting-patches/"><span class="doc">claiming tickets and submitting patches</span></a>.</p>   <h3 id="what-s-next-after-creating-a-pull-request">What’s next after creating a pull request?</h3> <p id="s-what-s-next-after-creating-a-pull-request">After a ticket has a patch, it needs to be reviewed by a second set of eyes. After submitting a pull request, update the ticket metadata by setting the flags on the ticket to say “has patch”, “doesn’t need tests”, etc, so others can find it for review. Contributing doesn’t necessarily always mean writing a patch from scratch. Reviewing existing patches is also a very helpful contribution. See <a class="reference internal" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/internals/contributing/triaging-tickets/"><span class="doc">Triaging tickets</span></a> for details.</p>
