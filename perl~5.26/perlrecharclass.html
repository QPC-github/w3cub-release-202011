<h2 id="NAME">NAME </h2> <p>perlrecharclass - Perl Regular Expression Character Classes</p> <h2 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h2> <p>The top level documentation about Perl regular expressions is found in <a href="perlre">perlre</a>.</p> <p>This manual page discusses the syntax and use of character classes in Perl regular expressions.</p> <p>A character class is a way of denoting a set of characters in such a way that one character of the set is matched. It's important to remember that: matching a character class consumes exactly one character in the source string. (The source string is the string the regular expression is matched against.)</p> <p>There are three types of character classes in Perl regular expressions: the dot, backslash sequences, and the form enclosed in square brackets. Keep in mind, though, that often the term "character class" is used to mean just the bracketed form. Certainly, most Perl documentation does that.</p> <h3 id="The-dot">The dot</h3> <p>The dot (or period), <code class="inline">.</code> is probably the most used, and certainly the most well-known character class. By default, a dot matches any character, except for the newline. That default can be changed to add matching the newline by using the <i>single line</i> modifier: either for the entire regular expression with the <code class="inline">/s</code> modifier, or locally with <code class="inline">(?s)</code>. (The <code class="inline"><a href="#%5cN">\N</a></code> backslash sequence, described below, matches any character except newline without regard to the <i>single line</i> modifier.)</p> <p>Here are some examples:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">"a"  =~  /./       # Match
"."  =~  /./       # Match
""   =~  /./       # No match (dot has to match a character)
"\n" =~  /./       # No match (dot does not match a newline)
"\n" =~  /./s      # Match (global 'single line' modifier)
"\n" =~  /(?s:.)/  # Match (local 'single line' modifier)
"ab" =~  /^.$/     # No match (dot matches one character)
</pre>
<h3 id="Backslash-sequences">Backslash sequences </h3> <p>A backslash sequence is a sequence of characters, the first one of which is a backslash. Perl ascribes special meaning to many such sequences, and some of these are character classes. That is, they match a single character each, provided that the character belongs to the specific set of characters defined by the sequence.</p> <p>Here's a list of the backslash sequences that are character classes. They are discussed in more detail below. (For the backslash sequences that aren't character classes, see <a href="perlrebackslash">perlrebackslash</a>.)</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">\d             Match a decimal digit character.
\D             Match a non-decimal-digit character.
\w             Match a "word" character.
\W             Match a non-"word" character.
\s             Match a whitespace character.
 \S             Match a non-whitespace character.
 \h             Match a horizontal whitespace character.
\H             Match a character that isn't horizontal whitespace.
\v             Match a vertical whitespace character.
\V             Match a character that isn't vertical whitespace.
\N             Match a character that isn't a newline.
\pP, \p{Prop}  Match a character that has the given Unicode property.
\PP, \P{Prop}  Match a character that doesn't have the Unicode property
</pre>
<h4 id="%5cN">\N</h4> <p><code class="inline">\<span class="w">N</span></code> , available starting in v5.12, like the dot, matches any character that is not a newline. The difference is that <code class="inline">\<span class="w">N</span></code> is not influenced by the <i>single line</i> regular expression modifier (see <a href="#The-dot">The dot</a> above). Note that the form <code class="inline">\<span class="i">N</span><span class="s">{</span>...<span class="s">}</span></code> may mean something completely different. When the <code class="inline"><span class="s">{</span>...<span class="s">}</span></code> is a <a href="perlre#Quantifiers">quantifier</a>, it means to match a non-newline character that many times. For example, <code class="inline">\<span class="i">N</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="n">3</span><span class="s">}</span></code> means to match 3 non-newlines; <code class="inline">\<span class="w">N</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="n">5</span><span class="cm">,</span><span class="s">}</span></code> means to match 5 or more non-newlines. But if <code class="inline"><span class="s">{</span>...<span class="s">}</span></code> is not a legal quantifier, it is presumed to be a named character. See <a href="charnames">charnames</a> for those. For example, none of <code class="inline">\<span class="i">N</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">COLON</span><span class="s">}</span></code> , <code class="inline">\N{4F}</code>, and <code class="inline">\<span class="i">N</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">F4</span><span class="s">}</span></code> contain legal quantifiers, so Perl will try to find characters whose names are respectively <code class="inline"><span class="w">COLON</span></code> , <code class="inline">4F</code>, and <code class="inline"><span class="w">F4</span></code> .</p> <h4 id="Digits">Digits</h4> <p><code class="inline">\<span class="w">d</span></code> matches a single character considered to be a decimal <i>digit</i>. If the <code class="inline"><span class="q">/a</span></code> regular expression modifier is in effect, it matches [0-9]. Otherwise, it matches anything that is matched by <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">Digit</span><span class="s">}</span></code> , which includes [0-9]. (An unlikely possible exception is that under locale matching rules, the current locale might not have <code class="inline"><span class="s">[</span><span class="n">0</span>-<span class="n">9</span><span class="s">]</span></code> matched by <code class="inline">\<span class="w">d</span></code> , and/or might match other characters whose code point is less than 256. The only such locale definitions that are legal would be to match <code class="inline"><span class="s">[</span><span class="n">0</span>-<span class="n">9</span><span class="s">]</span></code> plus another set of 10 consecutive digit characters; anything else would be in violation of the C language standard, but Perl doesn't currently assume anything in regard to this.)</p> <p>What this means is that unless the <code class="inline"><span class="q">/a</span></code> modifier is in effect <code class="inline">\<span class="w">d</span></code> not only matches the digits '0' - '9', but also Arabic, Devanagari, and digits from other languages. This may cause some confusion, and some security issues.</p> <p>Some digits that <code class="inline">\<span class="w">d</span></code> matches look like some of the [0-9] ones, but have different values. For example, BENGALI DIGIT FOUR (U+09EA) looks very much like an ASCII DIGIT EIGHT (U+0038). An application that is expecting only the ASCII digits might be misled, or if the match is <code class="inline">\<span class="w">d</span>+</code> , the matched string might contain a mixture of digits from different writing systems that look like they signify a number different than they actually do. <a href="unicode/ucd#num()">num() in Unicode::UCD</a> can be used to safely calculate the value, returning <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/undef">undef</a></code> if the input string contains such a mixture.</p> <p>What <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">Digit</span><span class="s">}</span></code> means (and hence <code class="inline">\<span class="w">d</span></code> except under the <code class="inline"><span class="q">/a</span></code> modifier) is <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">General_Category</span>=<span class="w">Decimal_Number</span><span class="s">}</span></code> , or synonymously, <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">General_Category</span>=<span class="w">Digit</span><span class="s">}</span></code> . Starting with Unicode version 4.1, this is the same set of characters matched by <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">Numeric_Type</span>=<span class="w">Decimal</span><span class="s">}</span></code> . But Unicode also has a different property with a similar name, <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">Numeric_Type</span>=<span class="w">Digit</span><span class="s">}</span></code> , which matches a completely different set of characters. These characters are things such as <code class="inline"><span class="w">CIRCLED</span> <span class="w">DIGIT</span> <span class="w">ONE</span></code> or subscripts, or are from writing systems that lack all ten digits.</p> <p>The design intent is for <code class="inline">\<span class="w">d</span></code> to exactly match the set of characters that can safely be used with "normal" big-endian positional decimal syntax, where, for example 123 means one 'hundred', plus two 'tens', plus three 'ones'. This positional notation does not necessarily apply to characters that match the other type of "digit", <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">Numeric_Type</span>=<span class="w">Digit</span><span class="s">}</span></code> , and so <code class="inline">\<span class="w">d</span></code> doesn't match them.</p> <p>The Tamil digits (U+0BE6 - U+0BEF) can also legally be used in old-style Tamil numbers in which they would appear no more than one in a row, separated by characters that mean "times 10", "times 100", etc. (See <a href="http://www.unicode.org/notes/tn21">http://www.unicode.org/notes/tn21</a>.)</p> <p>Any character not matched by <code class="inline">\<span class="w">d</span></code> is matched by <code class="inline">\<span class="w">D</span></code> .</p> <h4 id="Word-characters">Word characters</h4> <p>A <code class="inline">\<span class="w">w</span></code> matches a single alphanumeric character (an alphabetic character, or a decimal digit); or a connecting punctuation character, such as an underscore ("_"); or a "mark" character (like some sort of accent) that attaches to one of those. It does not match a whole word. To match a whole word, use <code class="inline">\<span class="w">w</span>+</code> . This isn't the same thing as matching an English word, but in the ASCII range it is the same as a string of Perl-identifier characters.</p> <ul> <li id="If-the-%2fa-modifier-is-in-effect-...">

This is indeed true starting in Perl v5.18, but prior to that, the sole difference was that the vertical tab (<code class="inline"><span class="q">"\cK"</span></code> ) was not matched by <code class="inline">\s</code>.</p> <p>The following table is a complete listing of characters matched by <code class="inline">\s</code>, <code class="inline">\<span class="w">h</span></code> and <code class="inline">\<span class="w">v</span></code> as of Unicode 6.3.</p> <p>The first column gives the Unicode code point of the character (in hex format), the second column gives the (Unicode) name.

When using braces, there is a single form, which is just the property name enclosed in the braces, and a compound form which looks like <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">name</span>=<span class="w">value</span><span class="s">}</span></code> , which means to match if the property "name" for the character has that particular "value". For instance, a match for a number can be written as <code class="inline"><span class="q">/\pN/</span></code> or as <code class="inline"><span class="q">/\p{Number}/</span></code> , or as <code class="inline"><span class="q">/\p{Number=True}/</span></code> . Lowercase letters are matched by the property <i>Lowercase_Letter</i> which has the short form <i>Ll</i>. They need the braces, so are written as <code class="inline"><span class="q">/\p{Ll}/</span></code> or <code class="inline"><span class="q">/\p{Lowercase_Letter}/</span></code> , or <code class="inline"><span class="q">/\p{General_Category=Lowercase_Letter}/</span></code> (the underscores are optional). <code class="inline"><span class="q">/\pLl/</span></code> is valid, but means something different. It matches a two character string: a letter (Unicode property <code class="inline">\<span class="w">pL</span></code> ), followed by a lowercase <code class="inline"><span class="w">l</span></code> .</p> <p>If locale rules are not in effect, the use of a Unicode property will force the regular expression into using Unicode rules, if it isn't already.</p> <p>Note that almost all properties are immune to case-insensitive matching. That is, adding a <code class="inline">/i</code> regular expression modifier does not change what they match. There are two sets that are affected. The first set is <code class="inline"><span class="w">Uppercase_Letter</span></code> , <code class="inline"><span class="w">Lowercase_Letter</span></code> , and <code class="inline"><span class="w">Titlecase_Letter</span></code> , all of which match <code class="inline"><span class="w">Cased_Letter</span></code> under <code class="inline">/i</code> matching. The second set is <code class="inline"><span class="w">Uppercase</span></code> , <code class="inline"><span class="w">Lowercase</span></code> , and <code class="inline"><span class="w">Titlecase</span></code> , all of which match <code class="inline"><span class="w">Cased</span></code> under <code class="inline">/i</code> matching. (The difference between these sets is that some things, such as Roman numerals, come in both upper and lower case, so they are <code class="inline"><span class="w">Cased</span></code> , but aren't considered to be letters, so they aren't <code class="inline"><span class="w">Cased_Letter</span></code> s. They're actually <code class="inline"><span class="w">Letter_Number</span></code> s.) This set also includes its subsets <code class="inline"><span class="w">PosixUpper</span></code> and <code class="inline"><span class="w">PosixLower</span></code> , both of which under <code class="inline">/i</code> match <code class="inline"><span class="w">PosixAlpha</span></code> .</p> <p>For more details on Unicode properties, see <a href="perlunicode#Unicode-Character-Properties">Unicode Character Properties in perlunicode</a>; for a complete list of possible properties, see <a href="perluniprops#Properties-accessible-through-%5cp%7b%7d-and-%5cP%7b%7d">Properties accessible through \p{} and \P{} in perluniprops</a>, which notes all forms that have <code class="inline">/i</code> differences. It is also possible to define your own properties. This is discussed in <a href="perlunicode#User-Defined-Character-Properties">User-Defined Character Properties in perlunicode</a>.</p> <p>Unicode properties are defined (surprise!) only on Unicode code points. Starting in v5.20, when matching against <code class="inline">\<span class="w">p</span></code> and <code class="inline">\<span class="w">P</span></code> , Perl treats non-Unicode code points (those above the legal Unicode maximum of 0x10FFFF) as if they were typical unassigned Unicode code points.</p> <p>Prior to v5.20, Perl raised a warning and made all matches fail on non-Unicode code points. This could be somewhat surprising:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">chr(0x110000) =~ \p{ASCII_Hex_Digit=True}     # Fails on Perls &lt; v5.20.
chr(0x110000) =~ \p{ASCII_Hex_Digit=False}    # Also fails on Perls
                                              # &lt; v5.20
</pre>
<p>Even though these two matches might be thought of as complements, until v5.20 they were so only on Unicode code points.</p> <h5>Examples</h5> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">"a"  =~  /\w/      # Match, "a" is a 'word' character.
"7"  =~  /\w/      # Match, "7" is a 'word' character as well.
"a"  =~  /\d/      # No match, "a" isn't a digit.
"7"  =~  /\d/      # Match, "7" is a digit.
" "  =~  /\s/      # Match, a space is whitespace.
"a"  =~  /\D/      # Match, "a" is a non-digit.
"7"  =~  /\D/      # No match, "7" is not a non-digit.
" "  =~  /\S/      # No match, a space is not non-whitespace.

" "  =~  /\h/      # Match, space is horizontal whitespace.
" "  =~  /\v/      # No match, space is not vertical whitespace.
"\r" =~  /\v/      # Match, a return is vertical whitespace.

"a"  =~  /\pL/     # Match, "a" is a letter.
"a"  =~  /\p{Lu}/  # No match, /\p{Lu}/ matches upper case letters.

"\x{0e0b}" =~ /\p{Thai}/  # Match, \x{0e0b} is the character
                          # 'THAI CHARACTER SO SO', and that's in
                          # Thai Unicode class.
"a"  =~  /\P{Lao}/ # Match, as "a" is not a Laotian character.
</pre>
<p>It is worth emphasizing that <code class="inline">\<span class="w">d</span></code> , <code class="inline">\<span class="w">w</span></code> , etc, match single characters, not complete numbers or words. To match a number (that consists of digits), use <code class="inline">\<span class="w">d</span>+</code> ; to match a word, use <code class="inline">\<span class="w">w</span>+</code> . But be aware of the security considerations in doing so, as mentioned above.</p> <h3 id="Bracketed-Character-Classes">Bracketed Character Classes</h3> <p>The third form of character class you can use in Perl regular expressions is the bracketed character class. In its simplest form, it lists the characters that may be matched, surrounded by square brackets, like this: <code class="inline"><span class="s">[</span><span class="w">aeiou</span><span class="s">]</span></code> . This matches one of <code class="inline"><span class="w">a</span></code> , <code class="inline"><span class="w">e</span></code> , <code class="inline"><span class="w">i</span></code> , <code class="inline"><span class="w">o</span></code> or <code class="inline"><span class="w">u</span></code> . Like the other character classes, exactly one character is matched.* To match a longer string consisting of characters mentioned in the character class, follow the character class with a <a href="perlre#Quantifiers">quantifier</a>. For instance, <code class="inline"><span class="s">[</span><span class="w">aeiou</span><span class="s">]</span>+</code> matches one or more lowercase English vowels.</p> <p>Repeating a character in a character class has no effect; it's considered to be in the set only once.</p> <p>Examples:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">"e"  =~  /[aeiou]/        # Match, as "e" is listed in the class.
"p"  =~  /[aeiou]/        # No match, "p" is not listed in the class.
"ae" =~  /^[aeiou]$/      # No match, a character class only matches
                          # a single character.
"ae" =~  /^[aeiou]+$/     # Match, due to the quantifier.

-------
</pre>
<p>* There are two exceptions to a bracketed character class matching a single character only. Each requires special handling by Perl to make things work:</p> <ul> <li> <p>When the class is to match caselessly under <code class="inline">/i</code> matching rules, and a character that is explicitly mentioned inside the class matches a multiple-character sequence caselessly under Unicode rules, the class will also match that sequence. For example, Unicode says that the letter <code class="inline"><span class="w">LATIN</span> <span class="w">SMALL</span> <span class="w">LETTER</span> <span class="w">SHARP</span> <span class="w">S</span></code> should match the sequence <code class="inline"><span class="w">ss</span></code> under <code class="inline">/i</code> rules. Thus,</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">'ss' =~ /\A\N{LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S}\z/i             # Matches
'ss' =~ /\A[aeioust\N{LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S}]\z/i    # Matches
</pre>
<p>For this to happen, the class must not be inverted (see <a href="#Negation">Negation</a>) and the character must be explicitly specified, and not be part of a multi-character range (not even as one of its endpoints). (<a href="#Character-Ranges">Character Ranges</a> will be explained shortly.) Therefore,</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">'ss' =~ /\A[\0-\x{ff}]\z/ui       # Doesn't match
'ss' =~ /\A[\0-\N{LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S}]\z/ui   # No match
'ss' =~ /\A[\xDF-\xDF]\z/ui   # Matches on ASCII platforms, since
                              # \xDF is LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S,
                              # and the range is just a single
                              # element
</pre>
<p>Note that it isn't a good idea to specify these types of ranges anyway.</p> </li> <li> <p>Some names known to <code class="inline">\<span class="i">N</span><span class="s">{</span>...<span class="s">}</span></code> refer to a sequence of multiple characters, instead of the usual single character. When one of these is included in the class, the entire sequence is matched. For example,</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">"\N{TAMIL LETTER KA}\N{TAMIL VOWEL SIGN AU}"
                            =~ / ^ [\N{TAMIL SYLLABLE KAU}]  $ /x;
</pre>
<p>matches, because <code class="inline">\<span class="i">N</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">TAMIL</span> <span class="w">SYLLABLE</span> <span class="w">KAU</span><span class="s">}</span></code> is a named sequence consisting of the two characters matched against. Like the other instance where a bracketed class can match multiple characters, and for similar reasons, the class must not be inverted, and the named sequence may not appear in a range, even one where it is both endpoints. If these happen, it is a fatal error if the character class is within an extended <a href="#Extended-Bracketed-Character-Classes">(?[...]) </a> class; and only the first code point is used (with a <code class="inline"><span class="w">regexp</span></code> -type warning raised) otherwise.</p> </li> </ul> <h4 id="Special-Characters-Inside-a-Bracketed-Character-Class">Special Characters Inside a Bracketed Character Class</h4> <p>Most characters that are meta characters in regular expressions (that is, characters that carry a special meaning like <code class="inline">.</code>, <code class="inline"><span class="i">*</span></code> , or <code class="inline">(</code>) lose their special meaning and can be used inside a character class without the need to escape them. For instance, <code class="inline"><span class="s">[</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span><span class="s">]</span></code> matches either an opening parenthesis, or a closing parenthesis, and the parens inside the character class don't group or capture.</p> <p>Characters that may carry a special meaning inside a character class are: <code class="inline">\</code> , <code class="inline">^</code>, <code class="inline">-</code> , <code class="inline">[</code> and <code class="inline">]</code>, and are discussed below. They can be escaped with a backslash, although this is sometimes not needed, in which case the backslash may be omitted.</p> <p>The sequence <code class="inline">\<span class="w">b</span></code> is special inside a bracketed character class. While outside the character class, <code class="inline">\<span class="w">b</span></code> is an assertion indicating a point that does not have either two word characters or two non-word characters on either side, inside a bracketed character class, <code class="inline">\<span class="w">b</span></code> matches a backspace character.</p> <p>The sequences <code class="inline">\<span class="w">a</span></code> , <code class="inline">\<span class="w">c</span></code> , <code class="inline">\<span class="w">e</span></code> , <code class="inline">\<span class="w">f</span></code> , <code class="inline">\<span class="w">n</span></code> , <code class="inline">\N{<i>NAME</i>}</code>, <code class="inline">\N{U+<i>hex char</i>}</code>, <code class="inline">\<span class="w">r</span></code> , <code class="inline">\<span class="w">t</span></code> , and <code class="inline">\<span class="w">x</span></code> are also special and have the same meanings as they do outside a bracketed character class.</p> <p>Also, a backslash followed by two or three octal digits is considered an octal number.</p> <p>A <code class="inline">[</code> is not special inside a character class, unless it's the start of a POSIX character class (see <a href="#POSIX-Character-Classes">POSIX Character Classes</a> below). It normally does not need escaping.</p> <p>A <code class="inline">]</code> is normally either the end of a POSIX character class (see <a href="#POSIX-Character-Classes">POSIX Character Classes</a> below), or it signals the end of the bracketed character class. If you want to include a <code class="inline">]</code> in the set of characters, you must generally escape it.</p> <p>However, if the <code class="inline">]</code> is the <i>first</i> (or the second if the first character is a caret) character of a bracketed character class, it does not denote the end of the class (as you cannot have an empty class) and is considered part of the set of characters that can be matched without escaping.</p> <p>Examples:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">"+"   =~ /[+?*]/     #  Match, "+" in a character class is not special.
"\cH" =~ /[\b]/      #  Match, \b inside in a character class
                     #  is equivalent to a backspace.
"]"   =~ /[][]/      #  Match, as the character class contains
                     #  both [ and ].
"[]"  =~ /[[]]/      #  Match, the pattern contains a character class
                     #  containing just [, and the character class is
                     #  followed by a ].
</pre>
<h4 id="Character-Ranges">Character Ranges</h4> <p>It is not uncommon to want to match a range of characters. Luckily, instead of listing all characters in the range, one may use the hyphen (<code class="inline">-</code> ). If inside a bracketed character class you have two characters separated by a hyphen, it's treated as if all characters between the two were in the class. For instance, <code class="inline"><span class="s">[</span><span class="n">0</span>-<span class="n">9</span><span class="s">]</span></code> matches any ASCII digit, and <code class="inline">[a-m]</code> matches any lowercase letter from the first half of the ASCII alphabet.</p> <p>Note that the two characters on either side of the hyphen are not necessarily both letters or both digits. Any character is possible, although not advisable. <code class="inline">['-?]</code> contains a range of characters, but most people will not know which characters that means. Furthermore, such ranges may lead to portability problems if the code has to run on a platform that uses a different character set, such as EBCDIC.</p> <p>If a hyphen in a character class cannot syntactically be part of a range, for instance because it is the first or the last character of the character class, or if it immediately follows a range, the hyphen isn't special, and so is considered a character to be matched literally. If you want a hyphen in your set of characters to be matched and its position in the class is such that it could be considered part of a range, you must escape that hyphen with a backslash.</p> <p>Examples:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">[a-z]       #  Matches a character that is a lower case ASCII letter.
[a-fz]      #  Matches any letter between 'a' and 'f' (inclusive) or
            #  the letter 'z'.
[-z]        #  Matches either a hyphen ('-') or the letter 'z'.
[a-f-m]     #  Matches any letter between 'a' and 'f' (inclusive), the
                         #  hyphen ('-'), or the letter 'm'.
 ['-?]       #  Matches any of the characters  '()*+,-./0123456789:;&lt;=&gt;?
            #  (But not on an EBCDIC platform).
[\N{APOSTROPHE}-\N{QUESTION MARK}]
            #  Matches any of the characters  '()*+,-./0123456789:;&lt;=&gt;?
            #  even on an EBCDIC platform.
[\N{U+27}-\N{U+3F}] # Same. (U+27 is "'", and U+3F is "?")
</pre>
<p>As the final two examples above show, you can achieve portablity to non-ASCII platforms by using the <code class="inline">\<span class="i">N</span><span class="s">{</span>...<span class="s">}</span></code> form for the range endpoints. These indicate that the specified range is to be interpreted using Unicode values, so <code class="inline"><span class="s">[</span>\<span class="i">N</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">U</span>+<span class="n">27</span><span class="s">}</span>-\<span class="i">N</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">U</span>+<span class="n">3</span><span class="w">F</span><span class="s">}</span><span class="s">]</span></code> means to match <code class="inline">\<span class="i">N</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">U</span>+<span class="n">27</span><span class="s">}</span></code> , <code class="inline">\<span class="i">N</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">U</span>+<span class="n">28</span><span class="s">}</span></code> , <code class="inline">\<span class="i">N</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">U</span>+<span class="n">29</span><span class="s">}</span></code> , ..., <code class="inline">\<span class="i">N</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">U</span>+<span class="n">3</span><span class="w">D</span><span class="s">}</span></code> , <code class="inline">\<span class="i">N</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">U</span>+<span class="n">3</span><span class="w">E</span><span class="s">}</span></code> , and <code class="inline">\<span class="i">N</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">U</span>+<span class="n">3</span><span class="w">F</span><span class="s">}</span></code> , whatever the native code point versions for those are. These are called "Unicode" ranges. If either end is of the <code class="inline">\<span class="i">N</span><span class="s">{</span>...<span class="s">}</span></code> form, the range is considered Unicode. A <code class="inline"><span class="w">regexp</span></code> warning is raised under <code class="inline"><span class="q">"use re 'strict'"</span></code> if the other endpoint is specified non-portably:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">[\N{U+00}-\x09]    # Warning under re 'strict'; \x09 is non-portable
[\N{U+00}-\t]      # No warning;
</pre>
<p>Both of the above match the characters <code class="inline">\<span class="i">N</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">U</span>+<span class="n">00</span><span class="s">}</span></code> <code class="inline">\<span class="i">N</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">U</span>+<span class="n">01</span><span class="s">}</span></code> , ... <code class="inline">\<span class="i">N</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">U</span>+<span class="n">08</span><span class="s">}</span></code> , <code class="inline">\<span class="i">N</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">U</span>+<span class="n">09</span><span class="s">}</span></code> , but the <code class="inline">\<span class="w">x09</span></code> looks like it could be a mistake so the warning is raised (under <code class="inline"><span class="w">re</span> <span class="q">'strict'</span></code> ) for it.</p> <p>Perl also guarantees that the ranges <code class="inline"><span class="w">A</span>-<span class="w">Z</span></code> , <code class="inline"><span class="w">a</span>-z</code> , <code class="inline"><span class="n">0</span>-<span class="n">9</span></code> , and any subranges of these match what an English-only speaker would expect them to match on any platform. That is, <code class="inline"><span class="s">[</span><span class="w">A</span>-<span class="w">Z</span><span class="s">]</span></code> matches the 26 ASCII uppercase letters; <code class="inline"><span class="s">[</span><span class="w">a</span>-z<span class="s">]</span></code> matches the 26 lowercase letters; and <code class="inline"><span class="s">[</span><span class="n">0</span>-<span class="n">9</span><span class="s">]</span></code> matches the 10 digits. Subranges, like <code class="inline"><span class="s">[</span><span class="w">h</span>-k<span class="s">]</span></code> , match correspondingly, in this case just the four letters <code class="inline"><span class="q">"h"</span></code> , <code class="inline"><span class="q">"i"</span></code> , <code class="inline"><span class="q">"j"</span></code> , and <code class="inline"><span class="q">"k"</span></code> . This is the natural behavior on ASCII platforms where the code points (ordinal values) for <code class="inline"><span class="q">"h"</span></code> through <code class="inline"><span class="q">"k"</span></code> are consecutive integers (0x68 through 0x6B). But special handling to achieve this may be needed on platforms with a non-ASCII native character set. For example, on EBCDIC platforms, the code point for <code class="inline"><span class="q">"h"</span></code> is 0x88, <code class="inline"><span class="q">"i"</span></code> is 0x89, <code class="inline"><span class="q">"j"</span></code> is 0x91, and <code class="inline"><span class="q">"k"</span></code> is 0x92. Perl specially treats <code class="inline"><span class="s">[</span><span class="w">h</span>-k<span class="s">]</span></code> to exclude the seven code points in the gap: 0x8A through 0x90. This special handling is only invoked when the range is a subrange of one of the ASCII uppercase, lowercase, and digit ranges, AND each end of the range is expressed either as a literal, like <code class="inline"><span class="q">"A"</span></code> , or as a named character (<code class="inline">\<span class="i">N</span><span class="s">{</span>...<span class="s">}</span></code> , including the <code class="inline">\<span class="i">N</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">U</span>+...</code> form).</p> <p>EBCDIC Examples:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">[i-j]               #  Matches either "i" or "j"
[i-\N{LATIN SMALL LETTER J}]  # Same
[i-\N{U+6A}]        #  Same
[\N{U+69}-\N{U+6A}] #  Same
[\x{89}-\x{91}]     #  Matches 0x89 ("i"), 0x8A .. 0x90, 0x91 ("j")
[i-\x{91}]          #  Same
[\x{89}-j]          #  Same
[i-J]               #  Matches, 0x89 ("i") .. 0xC1 ("J"); special
                    #  handling doesn't apply because range is mixed
                    #  case
</pre>
<h4 id="Negation">Negation</h4> <p>It is also possible to instead list the characters you do not want to match. You can do so by using a caret (<code class="inline">^</code>) as the first character in the character class. For instance, <code class="inline">[^a-z]</code> matches any character that is not a lowercase ASCII letter, which therefore includes more than a million Unicode code points. The class is said to be "negated" or "inverted".</p> <p>This syntax make the caret a special character inside a bracketed character class, but only if it is the first character of the class. So if you want the caret as one of the characters to match, either escape the caret or else don't list it first.</p> <p>In inverted bracketed character classes, Perl ignores the Unicode rules that normally say that named sequence, and certain characters should match a sequence of multiple characters use under caseless <code class="inline">/i</code> matching. Following those rules could lead to highly confusing situations:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">"ss" =~ /^[^\xDF]+$/ui;   # Matches!
</pre>
<p>This should match any sequences of characters that aren't <code class="inline">\<span class="w">xDF</span></code> nor what <code class="inline">\<span class="w">xDF</span></code> matches under <code class="inline">/i</code>. <code class="inline"><span class="q">"s"</span></code> isn't <code class="inline">\<span class="w">xDF</span></code> , but Unicode says that <code class="inline"><span class="q">"ss"</span></code> is what <code class="inline">\<span class="w">xDF</span></code> matches under <code class="inline">/i</code>. So which one "wins"? Do you fail the match because the string has <code class="inline"><span class="w">ss</span></code> or accept it because it has an <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/s">s</a></code> followed by another <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/s">s</a></code>? Perl has chosen the latter. (See note in <a href="#Bracketed-Character-Classes">Bracketed Character Classes</a> above.)</p> <p>Examples:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">"e"  =~  /[^aeiou]/   #  No match, the 'e' is listed.

<h4 id="Backslash-Sequences">Backslash Sequences</h4> <p>You can put any backslash sequence character class (with the exception of <code class="inline">\<span class="w">N</span></code> and <code class="inline">\<span class="w">R</span></code> ) inside a bracketed character class, and it will act just as if you had put all characters matched by the backslash sequence inside the character class. For instance, <code class="inline"><span class="s">[</span><span class="w">a</span>-f\<span class="w">d</span><span class="s">]</span></code> matches any decimal digit, or any of the lowercase letters between 'a' and 'f' inclusive.</p> <p><code class="inline">\<span class="w">N</span></code> within a bracketed character class must be of the forms <code class="inline">\N{<i>name</i>}</code> or <code class="inline">\N{U+<i>hex char</i>}</code>, and NOT be the form that matches non-newlines, for the same reason that a dot <code class="inline">.</code> inside a bracketed character class loses its special meaning: it matches nearly anything, which generally isn't what you want to happen.</p> <p>Examples:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">/[\p{Thai}\d]/     # Matches a character that is either a Thai
                   # character, or a digit.
/[^\p{Arabic}()]/  # Matches a character that is neither an Arabic
                   # character, nor a parenthesis.
</pre>
<p>Backslash sequence character classes cannot form one of the endpoints of a range. Thus, you can't say:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">/[\p{Thai}-\d]/     # Wrong!
</pre>
<h4 id="POSIX-Character-Classes">POSIX Character Classes </h4> <p>POSIX character classes have the form <code class="inline">[:class:]</code>, where <i>class</i> is the name, and the <code class="inline">[:</code> and <code class="inline">:]</code> delimiters. POSIX character classes only appear <i>inside</i> bracketed character classes, and are a convenient and descriptive way of listing a group of characters.</p> <p>Be careful about the syntax,</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl"># Correct:
$string =~ /[[:alpha:]]/

# Incorrect (will warn):
$string =~ /[:alpha:]/
</pre>
<p>The latter pattern would be a character class consisting of a colon, and the letters <code class="inline"><span class="w">a</span></code> , <code class="inline"><span class="w">l</span></code> , <code class="inline"><span class="w">p</span></code> and <code class="inline"><span class="w">h</span></code> .</p> <p>POSIX character classes can be part of a larger bracketed character class. For example,</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">[01[:alpha:]%]
</pre>
<p>is valid and matches '0', '1', any alphabetic character, and the percent sign.</p> <p>Perl recognizes the following POSIX character classes:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">alpha  Any alphabetical character ("[A-Za-z]").
alnum  Any alphanumeric character ("[A-Za-z0-9]").
ascii  Any character in the ASCII character set.
blank  A GNU extension, equal to a space or a horizontal tab ("\t").
cntrl  Any control character.  See Note [2] below.
digit  Any decimal digit ("[0-9]"), equivalent to "\d".
graph  Any printable character, excluding a space.  See Note [3] below.
lower  Any lowercase character ("[a-z]").
print  Any printable character, including a space.  See Note [4] below.
punct  Any graphical character excluding "word" characters.  Note [5].
space  Any whitespace character. "\s" including the vertical tab
       ("\cK").
upper  Any uppercase character ("[A-Z]").
word   A Perl extension ("[A-Za-z0-9_]"), equivalent to "\w".
xdigit Any hexadecimal digit ("[0-9a-fA-F]").
</pre>
<p>Like the <a href="#Unicode-Properties">Unicode properties</a>, most of the POSIX properties match the same regardless of whether case-insensitive (<code class="inline">/i</code>) matching is in effect or not. The two exceptions are <code class="inline">[:upper:]</code> and <code class="inline">[:lower:]</code>. Under <code class="inline">/i</code>, they each match the union of <code class="inline">[:upper:]</code> and <code class="inline">[:lower:]</code>.</p> <p>Most POSIX character classes have two Unicode-style <code class="inline">\<span class="w">p</span></code> property counterparts. (They are not official Unicode properties, but Perl extensions derived from official Unicode properties.) The table below shows the relation between POSIX character classes and these counterparts.</p> <p>One counterpart, in the column labelled "ASCII-range Unicode" in the table, matches only characters in the ASCII character set.</p> <p>The other counterpart, in the column labelled "Full-range Unicode", matches any appropriate characters in the full Unicode character set. For example, <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">Alpha</span><span class="s">}</span></code> matches not just the ASCII alphabetic characters, but any character in the entire Unicode character set considered alphabetic.

On ASCII platforms, this means they assume that the code points from 128 to 255 are Latin-1, and that means that using them under locale rules is unwise unless the locale is guaranteed to be Latin-1 or UTF-8. In contrast, the POSIX character classes are useful under locale rules. They are affected by the actual rules in effect, as follows:</p> <ul> <li id="If-the-%2fa-modifier%2c-is-in-effect-...">

This is done by prefixing the class name with a caret (<code class="inline">^</code>). Some examples:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">    POSIX         ASCII-range     Full-range  backslash
                   Unicode         Unicode    sequence
-----------------------------------------------------
[[:^digit:]]   \P{PosixDigit}  \P{XPosixDigit}   \D
[[:^space:]]   \P{PosixSpace}  \P{XPosixSpace}
               \P{PerlSpace}   \P{XPerlSpace}    \S
[[:^word:]]    \P{PerlWord}    \P{XPosixWord}    \W
</pre>
<p>The backslash sequence can mean either ASCII- or Full-range Unicode, depending on various factors as described in <a href="perlre#Which-character-set-modifier-is-in-effect%3f">Which character set modifier is in effect? in perlre</a>.</p> <h5>[= =] and [. .]</h5> <p>Perl recognizes the POSIX character classes <code class="inline"><span class="s">[</span>=<span class="w">class</span>=<span class="s">]</span></code> and <code class="inline">[.class.]</code>, but does not (yet?) support them. Any attempt to use either construct raises an exception.</p> <h5>Examples</h5> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">/[[:digit:]]/            # Matches a character that is a digit.
/[01[:lower:]]/          # Matches a character that is either a

 /[[:digit:][:^xdigit:]]/ # Matches a character that can be anything
                                                   # except the letters 'a' to 'f' and 'A' to

</pre>
<h4 id="Extended-Bracketed-Character-Classes">Extended Bracketed Character Classes </h4> <p>This is a fancy bracketed character class that can be used for more readable and less error-prone classes, and to perform set operations, such as intersection. An example is</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">/(?[ \p{Thai} &amp; \p{Digit} ])/
</pre>
<p>This will match all the digit characters that are in the Thai script.</p> <p>This is an experimental feature available starting in 5.18, and is subject to change as we gain field experience with it. Any attempt to use it will raise a warning, unless disabled via</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">no warnings "experimental::regex_sets";
</pre>
<p>Comments on this feature are welcome; send email to <code class="inline"><span class="w">perl5</span>-<span class="w">porters</span><span class="i">@perl</span>.<span class="w">org</span></code> .</p> <p>We can extend the example above:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">/(?[ ( \p{Thai} + \p{Lao} ) &amp; \p{Digit} ])/
</pre>
<p>This matches digits that are in either the Thai or Laotian scripts.</p> <p>Notice the white space in these examples. This construct always has the <code class="inline">/x</code> modifier turned on within it.</p> <p>The available binary operators are:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">&amp;    intersection
+    union
|    another name for '+', hence means union
-    subtraction (the result matches the set consisting of those
     code points matched by the first operand, excluding any that
     are also matched by the second operand)
^    symmetric difference (the union minus the intersection).  This
     is like an exclusive or, in that the result is the set of code
     points that are matched by either, but not both, of the
     operands.
</pre>
<p>There is one unary operator:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">!    complement
</pre>
<p>All the binary operators left associate; <code class="inline"><span class="q">"&amp;"</span></code> is higher precedence than the others, which all have equal precedence. The unary operator right associates, and has highest precedence. Thus this follows the normal Perl precedence rules for logical operators. Use parentheses to override the default precedence and associativity.</p> <p>The main restriction is that everything is a metacharacter. Thus, you cannot refer to single characters by doing something like this:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">/(?[ a + b ])/ # Syntax error!
</pre>
<p>The easiest way to specify an individual typable character is to enclose it in brackets:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">/(?[ [a] + [b] ])/
</pre>
<p>(This is the same thing as <code class="inline"><span class="s">[</span><span class="w">ab</span><span class="s">]</span></code> .) You could also have said the equivalent:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">/(?[[ a b ]])/
</pre>
<p>(You can, of course, specify single characters by using, <code class="inline">\<span class="i">x</span><span class="s">{</span>...<span class="s">}</span></code> , <code class="inline">\<span class="i">N</span><span class="s">{</span>...<span class="s">}</span></code> , etc.)</p> <p>This last example shows the use of this construct to specify an ordinary bracketed character class without additional set operations. Note the white space within it; <code class="inline">/x</code> is turned on even within bracketed character classes, except you can't have comments inside them. Hence,</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">(?[ [#] ])
</pre>
<p>matches the literal character "#". To specify a literal white space character, you can escape it with a backslash, like:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">/(?[ [ a e i o u \  ] ])/
</pre>
<p>This matches the English vowels plus the SPACE character. All the other escapes accepted by normal bracketed character classes are accepted here as well; but unrecognized escapes that generate warnings in normal classes are fatal errors here.</p> <p>All warnings from these class elements are fatal, as well as some practices that don't currently warn. For example you cannot say</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">/(?[ [ \xF ] ])/     # Syntax error!
</pre>
<p>You have to have two hex digits after a braceless <code class="inline">\<span class="w">x</span></code> (use a leading zero to make two). These restrictions are to lower the incidence of typos causing the class to not match what you thought it would.</p> <p>If a regular bracketed character class contains a <code class="inline">\<span class="w">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code> or <code class="inline">\<span class="w">P</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code> and is matched against a non-Unicode code point, a warning may be raised, as the result is not Unicode-defined. No such warning will come when using this extended form.</p> <p>The final difference between regular bracketed character classes and these, is that it is not possible to get these to match a multi-character fold. Thus,</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">/(?[ [\xDF] ])/iu
</pre>
<p>does not match the string <code class="inline"><span class="w">ss</span></code> .</p> <p>You don't have to enclose POSIX class names inside double brackets, hence both of the following work:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">/(?[ [:word:] - [:lower:] ])/
/(?[ [[:word:]] - [[:lower:]] ])/
</pre>
<p>Any contained POSIX character classes, including things like <code class="inline">\<span class="w">w</span></code> and <code class="inline">\<span class="w">D</span></code> respect the <code class="inline"><span class="q">/a</span></code> (and <code class="inline"><span class="q">/aa</span></code> ) modifiers.</p> <p><code class="inline"><span class="s">(</span><span class="q">?[ ])</span></code> is a regex-compile-time construct. Any attempt to use something which isn't knowable at the time the containing regular expression is compiled is a fatal error. In practice, this means just three limitations:</p> <dl> <dt>1</dt>
<dd> <p>This construct cannot be used within the scope of <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use">use</a> <span class="w">locale</span></code> (or the <code class="inline"><span class="q">/l</span></code> regex modifier).</p> </dd> <dt>2</dt>
<dd> <p>Any <a href="perlunicode#User-Defined-Character-Properties">user-defined property</a> used must be already defined by the time the regular expression is compiled (but note that this construct can be used instead of such properties).</p> </dd> <dt>3</dt>
<dd> <p>A regular expression that otherwise would compile using <code class="inline">/d</code> rules, and which uses this construct will instead use <code class="inline"><span class="q">/u</span></code> . Thus this construct tells Perl that you don't want <code class="inline">/d</code> rules for the entire regular expression containing it.</p> </dd> </dl> <p>Note that skipping white space applies only to the interior of this construct. There must not be any space between any of the characters that form the initial <code class="inline"><span class="s">(</span><span class="q">?[</span></code> . Nor may there be space between the closing <code class="inline">]<span class="p">)</span></code> characters.</p> <p>Just as in all regular expressions, the pattern can be built up by including variables that are interpolated at regex compilation time. Care must be taken to ensure that you are getting what you expect. For example:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">my $thai_or_lao = '\p{Thai} + \p{Lao}';
...
qr/(?[ \p{Digit} &amp; $thai_or_lao ])/;
</pre>
<p>compiles to</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">qr/(?[ \p{Digit} &amp; \p{Thai} + \p{Lao} ])/;
</pre>
<p>But this does not have the effect that someone reading the code would likely expect, as the intersection applies just to <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">Thai</span><span class="s">}</span></code> , excluding the Laotian. Pitfalls like this can be avoided by parenthesizing the component pieces:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">my $thai_or_lao = '( \p{Thai} + \p{Lao} )';
</pre>
<p>But any modifiers will still apply to all the components:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">my $lower = '\p{Lower} + \p{Digit}';
qr/(?[ \p{Greek} &amp; $lower ])/i;
</pre>
<p>matches upper case things. You can avoid surprises by making the components into instances of this construct by compiling them:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">my $thai_or_lao = qr/(?[ \p{Thai} + \p{Lao} ])/;
my $lower = qr/(?[ \p{Lower} + \p{Digit} ])/;
</pre>
<p>When these are embedded in another pattern, what they match does not change, regardless of parenthesization or what modifiers are in effect in that outer pattern.</p> <p>Due to the way that Perl parses things, your parentheses and brackets may need to be balanced, even including comments. If you run into any examples, please send them to <code class="inline"><span class="w">perlbug</span><span class="i">@perl</span>.<span class="w">org</span></code> , so that we can have a concrete example for this man page.</p> <p>We may change it so that things that remain legal uses in normal bracketed character classes might become illegal within this experimental construct. One proposal, for example, is to forbid adjacent uses of the same character, as in <code class="inline"><span class="s">(</span><span class="q">?[ [aa] ])</span></code> . The motivation for such a change is that this usage is likely a typo, as the second "a" adds nothing.</p>
