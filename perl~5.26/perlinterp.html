<h2 id="NAME">NAME</h2> <p>perlinterp - An overview of the Perl interpreter</p> <h2 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h2> <p>This document provides an overview of how the Perl interpreter works at the level of C code, along with pointers to the relevant C source code files.</p> <h2 id="ELEMENTS-OF-THE-INTERPRETER">ELEMENTS OF THE INTERPRETER</h2> <p>The work of the interpreter has two main stages: compiling the code into the internal representation, or bytecode, and then executing it. <a href="perlguts#Compiled-code">Compiled code in perlguts</a> explains exactly how the compilation stage happens.</p> <p>Here is a short breakdown of perl's operation:</p> <h3 id="Startup">Startup</h3> <p>The action begins in <i>perlmain.c</i>. (or <i>miniperlmain.c</i> for miniperl) This is very high-level code, enough to fit on a single screen, and it resembles the code found in <a href="perlembed">perlembed</a>; most of the real action takes place in <i>perl.c</i></p> <p><i>perlmain.c</i> is generated by <code class="inline"><span class="w">ExtUtils::Miniperl</span></code> from <i>miniperlmain.c</i> at make time, so you should make perl to follow this along.</p> <p>First, <i>perlmain.c</i> allocates some memory and constructs a Perl interpreter, along these lines:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">1 PERL_SYS_INIT3(&amp;argc,&amp;argv,&amp;env);
2
3 if (!PL_do_undump) {
4     my_perl = perl_alloc();
5     if (!my_perl)
6         exit(1);
7     perl_construct(my_perl);
8     PL_perl_destruct_level = 0;
9 }
</pre>
<p>Line 1 is a macro, and its definition is dependent on your operating system. Line 3 references <code class="inline"><span class="w">PL_do_undump</span></code> , a global variable - all global variables in Perl start with <code class="inline"><span class="w">PL_</span></code> . This tells you whether the current running program was created with the <code class="inline">-u</code> flag to perl and then <i>undump</i>, which means it's going to be false in any sane context.</p> <p>Line 4 calls a function in <i>perl.c</i> to allocate memory for a Perl interpreter. It's quite a simple function, and the guts of it looks like this:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">my_perl = (PerlInterpreter*)PerlMem_malloc(sizeof(PerlInterpreter));
</pre>
<p>Here you see an example of Perl's system abstraction, which we'll see later: <code class="inline"><span class="w">PerlMem_malloc</span></code> is either your system's <code class="inline"><span class="w">malloc</span></code> , or Perl's own <code class="inline"><span class="w">malloc</span></code> as defined in <i>malloc.c</i> if you selected that option at configure time.</p> <p>Next, in line 7, we construct the interpreter using perl_construct, also in <i>perl.c</i>; this sets up all the special variables that Perl needs, the stacks, and so on.</p> <p>Now we pass Perl the command line options, and tell it to go:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">exitstatus = perl_parse(my_perl, xs_init, argc, argv, (char **)NULL);
if (!exitstatus)
    perl_run(my_perl);

exitstatus = perl_destruct(my_perl);

perl_free(my_perl);
</pre>
<p><code class="inline"><span class="w">perl_parse</span></code> is actually a wrapper around <code class="inline"><span class="w">S_parse_body</span></code> , as defined in <i>perl.c</i>, which processes the command line options, sets up any statically linked XS modules, opens the program and calls <code class="inline"><span class="w">yyparse</span></code> to parse it.</p> <h3 id="Parsing">Parsing</h3> <p>The aim of this stage is to take the Perl source, and turn it into an op tree. We'll see what one of those looks like later. Strictly speaking, there's three things going on here.</p> <p><code class="inline"><span class="w">yyparse</span></code> , the parser, lives in <i>perly.c</i>, although you're better off reading the original YACC input in <i>perly.y</i>. (Yes, Virginia, there <b>is</b> a YACC grammar for Perl!) The job of the parser is to take your code and "understand" it, splitting it into sentences, deciding which operands go with which operators and so on.</p> <p>The parser is nobly assisted by the lexer, which chunks up your input into tokens, and decides what type of thing each token is: a variable name, an operator, a bareword, a subroutine, a core function, and so on. The main point of entry to the lexer is <code class="inline"><span class="w">yylex</span></code> , and that and its associated routines can be found in <i>toke.c</i>. Perl isn't much like other computer languages; it's highly context sensitive at times, it can be tricky to work out what sort of token something is, or where a token ends. As such, there's a lot of interplay between the tokeniser and the parser, which can get pretty frightening if you're not used to it.</p> <p>As the parser understands a Perl program, it builds up a tree of operations for the interpreter to perform during execution. The routines which construct and link together the various operations are to be found in <i>op.c</i>, and will be examined later.</p> <h3 id="Optimization">Optimization</h3> <p>Now the parsing stage is complete, and the finished tree represents the operations that the Perl interpreter needs to perform to execute our program. Next, Perl does a dry run over the tree looking for optimisations: constant expressions such as <code class="inline"><span class="n">3</span> + <span class="n">4</span></code> will be computed now, and the optimizer will also see if any multiple operations can be replaced with a single one. For instance, to fetch the variable <code class="inline"><span class="i">$foo</span></code> , instead of grabbing the glob <code class="inline"><span class="i">*foo</span></code> and looking at the scalar component, the optimizer fiddles the op tree to use a function which directly looks up the scalar in question. The main optimizer is <code class="inline"><span class="w">peep</span></code> in <i>op.c</i>, and many ops have their own optimizing functions.</p> <h3 id="Running">Running</h3> <p>Now we're finally ready to go: we have compiled Perl byte code, and all that's left to do is run it. The actual execution is done by the <code class="inline"><span class="w">runops_standard</span></code> function in <i>run.c</i>; more specifically, it's done by these three innocent looking lines:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">while ((PL_op = PL_op-&gt;op_ppaddr(aTHX))) {
    PERL_ASYNC_CHECK();
}
</pre>
<p>You may be more comfortable with the Perl version of that:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">PERL_ASYNC_CHECK() while $Perl::op = &amp;{$Perl::op-&gt;{function}};
</pre>
<p>Well, maybe not. Anyway, each op contains a function pointer, which stipulates the function which will actually carry out the operation. This function will return the next op in the sequence - this allows for things like <code class="inline">if</code> which choose the next op dynamically at run time. The <code class="inline"><span class="w">PERL_ASYNC_CHECK</span></code> makes sure that things like signals interrupt execution if required.</p> <p>The actual functions called are known as PP code, and they're spread between four files: <i>pp_hot.c</i> contains the "hot" code, which is most often used and highly optimized, <i>pp_sys.c</i> contains all the system-specific functions, <i>pp_ctl.c</i> contains the functions which implement control structures (<code class="inline">if</code> , <code class="inline">while</code> and the like) and <i>pp.c</i> contains everything else. These are, if you like, the C code for Perl's built-in functions and operators.</p> <p>Note that each <code class="inline"><span class="w">pp_</span></code> function is expected to return a pointer to the next op. Calls to perl subs (and eval blocks) are handled within the same runops loop, and do not consume extra space on the C stack. For example, <code class="inline"><span class="w">pp_entersub</span></code> and <code class="inline"><span class="w">pp_entertry</span></code> just push a <code class="inline"><span class="w">CxSUB</span></code> or <code class="inline"><span class="w">CxEVAL</span></code> block struct onto the context stack which contain the address of the op following the sub call or eval. They then return the first op of that sub or eval block, and so execution continues of that sub or block. Later, a <code class="inline"><span class="w">pp_leavesub</span></code> or <code class="inline"><span class="w">pp_leavetry</span></code> op pops the <code class="inline"><span class="w">CxSUB</span></code> or <code class="inline"><span class="w">CxEVAL</span></code> , retrieves the return op from it, and returns it.</p> <h3 id="Exception-handing">Exception handing</h3> <p>Perl's exception handing (i.e. <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/die">die</a></code> etc.) is built on top of the low-level <code class="inline"><span class="i">setjmp</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code> /<code class="inline"><span class="i">longjmp</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code> C-library functions. These basically provide a way to capture the current PC and SP registers and later restore them; i.e. a <code class="inline"><span class="i">longjmp</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code> continues at the point in code where a previous <code class="inline"><span class="i">setjmp</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code> was done, with anything further up on the C stack being lost. This is why code should always save values using <code class="inline"><span class="w">SAVE_FOO</span></code> rather than in auto variables.</p> <p>The perl core wraps <code class="inline"><span class="i">setjmp</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code> etc in the macros <code class="inline"><span class="w">JMPENV_PUSH</span></code> and <code class="inline"><span class="w">JMPENV_JUMP</span></code> . The basic rule of perl exceptions is that <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/exit">exit</a></code>, and <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/die">die</a></code> (in the absence of <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/eval">eval</a></code>) perform a <code class="inline"><span class="i">JMPENV_JUMP</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="n">2</span><span class="s">)</span></code> , while <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/die">die</a></code> within <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/eval">eval</a></code> does a <code class="inline"><span class="i">JMPENV_JUMP</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="n">3</span><span class="s">)</span></code> .</p> <p>At entry points to perl, such as <code class="inline"><span class="i">perl_parse</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code> , <code class="inline"><span class="i">perl_run</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code> and <code class="inline"><span class="i">call_sv</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="w">cv</span><span class="cm">,</span> <span class="w">G_EVAL</span><span class="s">)</span></code> each does a <code class="inline"><span class="w">JMPENV_PUSH</span></code> , then enter a runops loop or whatever, and handle possible exception returns. For a 2 return, final cleanup is performed, such as popping stacks and calling <code class="inline">CHECK</code> or <code class="inline">END</code> blocks. Amongst other things, this is how scope cleanup still occurs during an <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/exit">exit</a></code>.</p> <p>If a <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/die">die</a></code> can find a <code class="inline"><span class="w">CxEVAL</span></code> block on the context stack, then the stack is popped to that level and the return op in that block is assigned to <code class="inline"><span class="w">PL_restartop</span></code> ; then a <code class="inline"><span class="i">JMPENV_JUMP</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="n">3</span><span class="s">)</span></code> is performed. This normally passes control back to the guard. In the case of <code class="inline"><span class="w">perl_run</span></code> and <code class="inline"><span class="w">call_sv</span></code> , a non-null <code class="inline"><span class="w">PL_restartop</span></code> triggers re-entry to the runops loop. The is the normal way that <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/die">die</a></code> or <code class="inline"><span class="w">croak</span></code> is handled within an <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/eval">eval</a></code>.</p> <p>Sometimes ops are executed within an inner runops loop, such as tie, sort or overload code. In this case, something like</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">sub FETCH { eval { die } }
</pre>
<p>would cause a longjmp right back to the guard in <code class="inline"><span class="w">perl_run</span></code> , popping both runops loops, which is clearly incorrect. One way to avoid this is for the tie code to do a <code class="inline"><span class="w">JMPENV_PUSH</span></code> before executing <code class="inline"><span class="w">FETCH</span></code> in the inner runops loop, but for efficiency reasons, perl in fact just sets a flag, using <code class="inline"><span class="i">CATCH_SET</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="w">TRUE</span><span class="s">)</span></code> . The <code class="inline"><span class="w">pp_require</span></code> , <code class="inline"><span class="w">pp_entereval</span></code> and <code class="inline"><span class="w">pp_entertry</span></code> ops check this flag, and if true, they call <code class="inline"><span class="w">docatch</span></code> , which does a <code class="inline"><span class="w">JMPENV_PUSH</span></code> and starts a new runops level to execute the code, rather than doing it on the current loop.</p> <p>As a further optimisation, on exit from the eval block in the <code class="inline"><span class="w">FETCH</span></code> , execution of the code following the block is still carried on in the inner loop. When an exception is raised, <code class="inline"><span class="w">docatch</span></code> compares the <code class="inline"><span class="w">JMPENV</span></code> level of the <code class="inline"><span class="w">CxEVAL</span></code> with <code class="inline"><span class="w">PL_top_env</span></code> and if they differ, just re-throws the exception. In this way any inner loops get popped.</p> <p>Here's an example.</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">1: eval { tie @a, 'A' };
2: sub A::TIEARRAY {
3:     eval { die };
4:     die;
5: }
</pre>
<p>To run this code, <code class="inline"><span class="w">perl_run</span></code> is called, which does a <code class="inline"><span class="w">JMPENV_PUSH</span></code> then enters a runops loop. This loop executes the eval and tie ops on line 1, with the eval pushing a <code class="inline"><span class="w">CxEVAL</span></code> onto the context stack.</p> <p>The <code class="inline"><span class="w">pp_tie</span></code> does a <code class="inline"><span class="i">CATCH_SET</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="w">TRUE</span><span class="s">)</span></code> , then starts a second runops loop to execute the body of <code class="inline"><span class="w">TIEARRAY</span></code> . When it executes the entertry op on line 3, <code class="inline"><span class="w">CATCH_GET</span></code> is true, so <code class="inline"><span class="w">pp_entertry</span></code> calls <code class="inline"><span class="w">docatch</span></code> which does a <code class="inline"><span class="w">JMPENV_PUSH</span></code> and starts a third runops loop, which then executes the die op. At this point the C call stack looks like this:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">Perl_pp_die
Perl_runops      # third loop
S_docatch_body
S_docatch
Perl_pp_entertry
Perl_runops      # second loop
S_call_body
Perl_call_sv
Perl_pp_tie
Perl_runops      # first loop
S_run_body
perl_run
main
</pre>
<p>and the context and data stacks, as shown by <code class="inline">-<span class="w">Dstv</span></code> , look like:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">STACK 0: MAIN
  CX 0: BLOCK  =&gt;
  CX 1: EVAL   =&gt; AV()  PV("A"\0)
  retop=leave
STACK 1: MAGIC
  CX 0: SUB    =&gt;
  retop=(null)
  CX 1: EVAL   =&gt; *
retop=nextstate
</pre>
<p>The die pops the first <code class="inline"><span class="w">CxEVAL</span></code> off the context stack, sets <code class="inline"><span class="w">PL_restartop</span></code> from it, does a <code class="inline"><span class="i">JMPENV_JUMP</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="n">3</span><span class="s">)</span></code> , and control returns to the top <code class="inline"><span class="w">docatch</span></code> . This then starts another third-level runops level, which executes the nextstate, pushmark and die ops on line 4. At the point that the second <code class="inline"><span class="w">pp_die</span></code> is called, the C call stack looks exactly like that above, even though we are no longer within an inner eval; this is because of the optimization mentioned earlier. However, the context stack now looks like this, ie with the top CxEVAL popped:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">STACK 0: MAIN
  CX 0: BLOCK  =&gt;
  CX 1: EVAL   =&gt; AV()  PV("A"\0)
  retop=leave
STACK 1: MAGIC
  CX 0: SUB    =&gt;
  retop=(null)
</pre>
<p>The die on line 4 pops the context stack back down to the CxEVAL, leaving it as:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">STACK 0: MAIN
  CX 0: BLOCK  =&gt;
</pre>
<p>As usual, <code class="inline"><span class="w">PL_restartop</span></code> is extracted from the <code class="inline"><span class="w">CxEVAL</span></code> , and a <code class="inline"><span class="i">JMPENV_JUMP</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="n">3</span><span class="s">)</span></code> done, which pops the C stack back to the docatch:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">S_docatch
Perl_pp_entertry
Perl_runops      # second loop
S_call_body
Perl_call_sv
Perl_pp_tie
Perl_runops      # first loop
S_run_body
perl_run
main
</pre>
<p>In this case, because the <code class="inline"><span class="w">JMPENV</span></code> level recorded in the <code class="inline"><span class="w">CxEVAL</span></code> differs from the current one, <code class="inline"><span class="w">docatch</span></code> just does a <code class="inline"><span class="i">JMPENV_JUMP</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="n">3</span><span class="s">)</span></code> and the C stack unwinds to:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">perl_run
main
</pre>
<p>Because <code class="inline"><span class="w">PL_restartop</span></code> is non-null, <code class="inline"><span class="w">run_body</span></code> starts a new runops loop and execution continues.</p> <h3 id="INTERNAL-VARIABLE-TYPES">INTERNAL VARIABLE TYPES</h3> <p>You should by now have had a look at <a href="perlguts">perlguts</a>, which tells you about Perl's internal variable types: SVs, HVs, AVs and the rest. If not, do that now.</p> <p>These variables are used not only to represent Perl-space variables, but also any constants in the code, as well as some structures completely internal to Perl. The symbol table, for instance, is an ordinary Perl hash. Your code is represented by an SV as it's read into the parser; any program files you call are opened via ordinary Perl filehandles, and so on.</p> <p>The core <a href="devel/peek">Devel::Peek</a> module lets us examine SVs from a Perl program. Let's see, for instance, how Perl treats the constant <code class="inline"><span class="q">"hello"</span></code> .</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">  % perl -MDevel::Peek -e 'Dump("hello")'
1 SV = PV(0xa041450) at 0xa04ecbc
2   REFCNT = 1
3   FLAGS = (POK,READONLY,pPOK)
4   PV = 0xa0484e0 "hello"\0
5   CUR = 5
6   LEN = 6
</pre>
<p>Reading <code class="inline"><span class="w">Devel::Peek</span></code> output takes a bit of practise, so let's go through it line by line.</p> <p>Line 1 tells us we're looking at an SV which lives at <code class="inline"><span class="n">0xa04ecbc</span></code> in memory. SVs themselves are very simple structures, but they contain a pointer to a more complex structure. In this case, it's a PV, a structure which holds a string value, at location <code class="inline"><span class="n">0xa041450</span></code> . Line 2 is the reference count; there are no other references to this data, so it's 1.</p> <p>Line 3 are the flags for this SV - it's OK to use it as a PV, it's a read-only SV (because it's a constant) and the data is a PV internally. Next we've got the contents of the string, starting at location <code class="inline"><span class="n">0xa0484e0</span></code> .</p> <p>Line 5 gives us the current length of the string - note that this does <b>not</b> include the null terminator. Line 6 is not the length of the string, but the length of the currently allocated buffer; as the string grows, Perl automatically extends the available storage via a routine called <code class="inline"><span class="w">SvGROW</span></code> .</p> <p>You can get at any of these quantities from C very easily; just add <code class="inline"><span class="w">Sv</span></code> to the name of the field shown in the snippet, and you've got a macro which will return the value: <code class="inline"><span class="i">SvCUR</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="w">sv</span><span class="s">)</span></code> returns the current length of the string, <code class="inline"><span class="i">SvREFCOUNT</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="w">sv</span><span class="s">)</span></code> returns the reference count, <code class="inline"><span class="i">SvPV</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="w">sv</span><span class="cm">,</span> <span class="w">len</span><span class="s">)</span></code> returns the string itself with its length, and so on. More macros to manipulate these properties can be found in <a href="perlguts">perlguts</a>.</p> <p>Let's take an example of manipulating a PV, from <code class="inline"><span class="w">sv_catpvn</span></code> , in <i>sv.c</i></p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl"> 1  void
 2  Perl_sv_catpvn(pTHX_ SV *sv, const char *ptr, STRLEN len)
 3  {
 4      STRLEN tlen;
 5      char *junk;

 6      junk = SvPV_force(sv, tlen);
 7      SvGROW(sv, tlen + len + 1);
 8      if (ptr == junk)
 9          ptr = SvPVX(sv);
10      Move(ptr,SvPVX(sv)+tlen,len,char);
11      SvCUR(sv) += len;
12      *SvEND(sv) = '\0';
13      (void)SvPOK_only_UTF8(sv);          /* validate pointer */
14      SvTAINT(sv);
15  }
</pre>
<p>This is a function which adds a string, <code class="inline"><span class="w">ptr</span></code> , of length <code class="inline"><span class="w">len</span></code> onto the end of the PV stored in <code class="inline"><span class="w">sv</span></code> . The first thing we do in line 6 is make sure that the SV <b>has</b> a valid PV, by calling the <code class="inline"><span class="w">SvPV_force</span></code> macro to force a PV. As a side effect, <code class="inline"><span class="w">tlen</span></code> gets set to the current value of the PV, and the PV itself is returned to <code class="inline"><span class="w">junk</span></code> .</p> <p>In line 7, we make sure that the SV will have enough room to accommodate the old string, the new string and the null terminator. If <code class="inline"><span class="w">LEN</span></code> isn't big enough, <code class="inline"><span class="w">SvGROW</span></code> will reallocate space for us.</p> <p>Now, if <code class="inline"><span class="w">junk</span></code> is the same as the string we're trying to add, we can grab the string directly from the SV; <code class="inline"><span class="w">SvPVX</span></code> is the address of the PV in the SV.</p> <p>Line 10 does the actual catenation: the <code class="inline"><span class="w">Move</span></code> macro moves a chunk of memory around: we move the string <code class="inline"><span class="w">ptr</span></code> to the end of the PV - that's the start of the PV plus its current length. We're moving <code class="inline"><span class="w">len</span></code> bytes of type <code class="inline"><span class="w">char</span></code> . After doing so, we need to tell Perl we've extended the string, by altering <code class="inline"><span class="w">CUR</span></code> to reflect the new length. <code class="inline"><span class="w">SvEND</span></code> is a macro which gives us the end of the string, so that needs to be a <code class="inline"><span class="q">"\0"</span></code> .</p> <p>Line 13 manipulates the flags; since we've changed the PV, any IV or NV values will no longer be valid: if we have <code class="inline"><span class="i">$a</span>=<span class="n">10</span><span class="sc">;</span> <span class="i">$a</span>.=<span class="q">"6"</span><span class="sc">;</span></code> we don't want to use the old IV of 10. <code class="inline"><span class="w">SvPOK_only_utf8</span></code> is a special UTF-8-aware version of <code class="inline"><span class="w">SvPOK_only</span></code> , a macro which turns off the IOK and NOK flags and turns on POK. The final <code class="inline"><span class="w">SvTAINT</span></code> is a macro which launders tainted data if taint mode is turned on.</p> <p>AVs and HVs are more complicated, but SVs are by far the most common variable type being thrown around. Having seen something of how we manipulate these, let's go on and look at how the op tree is constructed.</p> <h2 id="OP-TREES">OP TREES</h2> <p>First, what is the op tree, anyway? The op tree is the parsed representation of your program, as we saw in our section on parsing, and it's the sequence of operations that Perl goes through to execute your program, as we saw in <a href="#Running">Running</a>.</p> <p>An op is a fundamental operation that Perl can perform: all the built-in functions and operators are ops, and there are a series of ops which deal with concepts the interpreter needs internally - entering and leaving a block, ending a statement, fetching a variable, and so on.</p> <p>The op tree is connected in two ways: you can imagine that there are two "routes" through it, two orders in which you can traverse the tree. First, parse order reflects how the parser understood the code, and secondly, execution order tells perl what order to perform the operations in.</p> <p>The easiest way to examine the op tree is to stop Perl after it has finished parsing, and get it to dump out the tree. This is exactly what the compiler backends <a href="b/terse">B::Terse</a>, <a href="b/concise">B::Concise</a> and <a href="b/debug">B::Debug</a> do.</p> <p>Let's have a look at how Perl sees <code class="inline"><span class="i">$a</span> = <span class="i">$b</span> + <span class="i">$c</span></code> :</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl"> % perl -MO=Terse -e '$a=$b+$c'
 1  LISTOP (0x8179888) leave
 2      OP (0x81798b0) enter
 3      COP (0x8179850) nextstate
 4      BINOP (0x8179828) sassign
 5          BINOP (0x8179800) add [1]
 6              UNOP (0x81796e0) null [15]
 7                  SVOP (0x80fafe0) gvsv  GV (0x80fa4cc) *b
 8              UNOP (0x81797e0) null [15]
 9                  SVOP (0x8179700) gvsv  GV (0x80efeb0) *c
10          UNOP (0x816b4f0) null [15]
11              SVOP (0x816dcf0) gvsv  GV (0x80fa460) *a
</pre>
<p>Let's start in the middle, at line 4. This is a BINOP, a binary operator, which is at location <code class="inline"><span class="n">0x8179828</span></code> . The specific operator in question is <code class="inline"><span class="w">sassign</span></code> - scalar assignment - and you can find the code which implements it in the function <code class="inline"><span class="w">pp_sassign</span></code> in <i>pp_hot.c</i>. As a binary operator, it has two children: the add operator, providing the result of <code class="inline"><span class="i">$b</span>+<span class="i">$c</span></code> , is uppermost on line 5, and the left hand side is on line 10.</p> <p>Line 10 is the null op: this does exactly nothing. What is that doing there? If you see the null op, it's a sign that something has been optimized away after parsing. As we mentioned in <a href="#Optimization">Optimization</a>, the optimization stage sometimes converts two operations into one, for example when fetching a scalar variable. When this happens, instead of rewriting the op tree and cleaning up the dangling pointers, it's easier just to replace the redundant operation with the null op. Originally, the tree would have looked like this:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">10          SVOP (0x816b4f0) rv2sv [15]
11              SVOP (0x816dcf0) gv  GV (0x80fa460) *a
</pre>
<p>That is, fetch the <code class="inline"><span class="w">a</span></code> entry from the main symbol table, and then look at the scalar component of it: <code class="inline"><span class="w">gvsv</span></code> (<code class="inline"><span class="w">pp_gvsv</span></code> into <i>pp_hot.c</i>) happens to do both these things.</p> <p>The right hand side, starting at line 5 is similar to what we've just seen: we have the <code class="inline"><span class="w">add</span></code> op (<code class="inline"><span class="w">pp_add</span></code> also in <i>pp_hot.c</i>) add together two <code class="inline"><span class="w">gvsv</span></code> s.</p> <p>Now, what's this about?</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">1  LISTOP (0x8179888) leave
2      OP (0x81798b0) enter
3      COP (0x8179850) nextstate
</pre>
<p><code class="inline"><span class="w">enter</span></code> and <code class="inline"><span class="w">leave</span></code> are scoping ops, and their job is to perform any housekeeping every time you enter and leave a block: lexical variables are tidied up, unreferenced variables are destroyed, and so on. Every program will have those first three lines: <code class="inline"><span class="w">leave</span></code> is a list, and its children are all the statements in the block. Statements are delimited by <code class="inline"><span class="w">nextstate</span></code> , so a block is a collection of <code class="inline"><span class="w">nextstate</span></code> ops, with the ops to be performed for each statement being the children of <code class="inline"><span class="w">nextstate</span></code> . <code class="inline"><span class="w">enter</span></code> is a single op which functions as a marker.</p> <p>That's how Perl parsed the program, from top to bottom:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl"> Program
    |
Statement
    |
    =
   / \
  /   \
 $a   +
     / \
   $b   $c
</pre>
<p>However, it's impossible to <b>perform</b> the operations in this order: you have to find the values of <code class="inline"><span class="i">$b</span></code> and <code class="inline"><span class="i">$c</span></code> before you add them together, for instance. So, the other thread that runs through the op tree is the execution order: each op has a field <code class="inline"><span class="w">op_next</span></code> which points to the next op to be run, so following these pointers tells us how perl executes the code. We can traverse the tree in this order using the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/exec">exec</a></code> option to <code class="inline"><span class="w">B::Terse</span></code> :</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">% perl -MO=Terse,exec -e '$a=$b+$c'
1  OP (0x8179928) enter
2  COP (0x81798c8) nextstate
3  SVOP (0x81796c8) gvsv  GV (0x80fa4d4) *b
4  SVOP (0x8179798) gvsv  GV (0x80efeb0) *c
5  BINOP (0x8179878) add [1]
6  SVOP (0x816dd38) gvsv  GV (0x80fa468) *a
7  BINOP (0x81798a0) sassign
8  LISTOP (0x8179900) leave
</pre>
<p>This probably makes more sense for a human: enter a block, start a statement. Get the values of <code class="inline"><span class="i">$b</span></code> and <code class="inline"><span class="i">$c</span></code> , and add them together. Find <code class="inline"><span class="i">$a</span></code> , and assign one to the other. Then leave.</p> <p>The way Perl builds up these op trees in the parsing process can be unravelled by examining <i>perly.y</i>, the YACC grammar. Let's take the piece we need to construct the tree for <code class="inline"><span class="i">$a</span> = <span class="i">$b</span> + <span class="i">$c</span></code> </p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">1 term    :   term ASSIGNOP term
2                { $$ = newASSIGNOP(OPf_STACKED, $1, $2, $3); }
3         |   term ADDOP term
4                { $$ = newBINOP($2, 0, scalar($1), scalar($3)); }
</pre>
<p>If you're not used to reading BNF grammars, this is how it works: You're fed certain things by the tokeniser, which generally end up in upper case. Here, <code class="inline"><span class="w">ADDOP</span></code> , is provided when the tokeniser sees <code class="inline">+</code> in your code. <code class="inline"><span class="w">ASSIGNOP</span></code> is provided when <code class="inline">=</code> is used for assigning. These are "terminal symbols", because you can't get any simpler than them.</p> <p>The grammar, lines one and three of the snippet above, tells you how to build up more complex forms. These complex forms, "non-terminal symbols" are generally placed in lower case. <code class="inline"><span class="w">term</span></code> here is a non-terminal symbol, representing a single expression.</p> <p>The grammar gives you the following rule: you can make the thing on the left of the colon if you see all the things on the right in sequence. This is called a "reduction", and the aim of parsing is to completely reduce the input. There are several different ways you can perform a reduction, separated by vertical bars: so, <code class="inline"><span class="w">term</span></code> followed by <code class="inline">=</code> followed by <code class="inline"><span class="w">term</span></code> makes a <code class="inline"><span class="w">term</span></code> , and <code class="inline"><span class="w">term</span></code> followed by <code class="inline">+</code> followed by <code class="inline"><span class="w">term</span></code> can also make a <code class="inline"><span class="w">term</span></code> .</p> <p>So, if you see two terms with an <code class="inline">=</code> or <code class="inline">+</code> , between them, you can turn them into a single expression. When you do this, you execute the code in the block on the next line: if you see <code class="inline">=</code> , you'll do the code in line 2. If you see <code class="inline">+</code> , you'll do the code in line 4. It's this code which contributes to the op tree.</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">|   term ADDOP term
{ $$ = newBINOP($2, 0, scalar($1), scalar($3)); }
</pre>
<p>What this does is creates a new binary op, and feeds it a number of variables. The variables refer to the tokens: <code class="inline"><span class="i">$1</span></code> is the first token in the input, <code class="inline"><span class="i">$2</span></code> the second, and so on - think regular expression backreferences. <code class="inline"><span class="i">$$</span></code> is the op returned from this reduction. So, we call <code class="inline"><span class="w">newBINOP</span></code> to create a new binary operator. The first parameter to <code class="inline"><span class="w">newBINOP</span></code> , a function in <i>op.c</i>, is the op type. It's an addition operator, so we want the type to be <code class="inline"><span class="w">ADDOP</span></code> . We could specify this directly, but it's right there as the second token in the input, so we use <code class="inline"><span class="i">$2</span></code> . The second parameter is the op's flags: 0 means "nothing special". Then the things to add: the left and right hand side of our expression, in scalar context.</p> <h2 id="STACKS">STACKS</h2> <p>When perl executes something like <code class="inline"><span class="w">addop</span></code> , how does it pass on its results to the next op? The answer is, through the use of stacks. Perl has a number of stacks to store things it's currently working on, and we'll look at the three most important ones here.</p> <h3 id="Argument-stack">Argument stack</h3> <p>Arguments are passed to PP code and returned from PP code using the argument stack, <code class="inline"><span class="w">ST</span></code> . The typical way to handle arguments is to pop them off the stack, deal with them how you wish, and then push the result back onto the stack. This is how, for instance, the cosine operator works:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">NV value;
value = POPn;
value = Perl_cos(value);
XPUSHn(value);
</pre>
<p>We'll see a more tricky example of this when we consider Perl's macros below. <code class="inline"><span class="w">POPn</span></code> gives you the NV (floating point value) of the top SV on the stack: the <code class="inline"><span class="i">$x</span></code> in <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/cos">cos($x)</a></code>. Then we compute the cosine, and push the result back as an NV. The <code class="inline"><span class="w">X</span></code> in <code class="inline"><span class="w">XPUSHn</span></code> means that the stack should be extended if necessary - it can't be necessary here, because we know there's room for one more item on the stack, since we've just removed one! The <code class="inline"><span class="w">XPUSH</span>*</code> macros at least guarantee safety.</p> <p>Alternatively, you can fiddle with the stack directly: <code class="inline"><span class="w">SP</span></code> gives you the first element in your portion of the stack, and <code class="inline"><span class="w">TOP</span>*</code> gives you the top SV/IV/NV/etc. on the stack. So, for instance, to do unary negation of an integer:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">SETi(-TOPi);
</pre>
<p>Just set the integer value of the top stack entry to its negation.</p> <p>Argument stack manipulation in the core is exactly the same as it is in XSUBs - see <a href="perlxstut">perlxstut</a>, <a href="perlxs">perlxs</a> and <a href="perlguts">perlguts</a> for a longer description of the macros used in stack manipulation.</p> <h3 id="Mark-stack">Mark stack</h3> <p>I say "your portion of the stack" above because PP code doesn't necessarily get the whole stack to itself: if your function calls another function, you'll only want to expose the arguments aimed for the called function, and not (necessarily) let it get at your own data. The way we do this is to have a "virtual" bottom-of-stack, exposed to each function. The mark stack keeps bookmarks to locations in the argument stack usable by each function. For instance, when dealing with a tied variable, (internally, something with "P" magic) Perl has to call methods for accesses to the tied variables. However, we need to separate the arguments exposed to the method to the argument exposed to the original function - the store or fetch or whatever it may be. Here's roughly how the tied <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/push">push</a></code> is implemented; see <code class="inline"><span class="w">av_push</span></code> in <i>av.c</i>:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">1	PUSHMARK(SP);
2	EXTEND(SP,2);
3	PUSHs(SvTIED_obj((SV*)av, mg));
4	PUSHs(val);
5	PUTBACK;
6	ENTER;
7	call_method("PUSH", G_SCALAR|G_DISCARD);
8	LEAVE;
</pre>
<p>Let's examine the whole implementation, for practice:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">1	PUSHMARK(SP);
</pre>
<p>Push the current state of the stack pointer onto the mark stack. This is so that when we've finished adding items to the argument stack, Perl knows how many things we've added recently.</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">2	EXTEND(SP,2);
3	PUSHs(SvTIED_obj((SV*)av, mg));
4	PUSHs(val);
</pre>
<p>We're going to add two more items onto the argument stack: when you have a tied array, the <code class="inline"><span class="w">PUSH</span></code> subroutine receives the object and the value to be pushed, and that's exactly what we have here - the tied object, retrieved with <code class="inline"><span class="w">SvTIED_obj</span></code> , and the value, the SV <code class="inline"><span class="w">val</span></code> .</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">5	PUTBACK;
</pre>
<p>Next we tell Perl to update the global stack pointer from our internal variable: <code class="inline"><span class="w">dSP</span></code> only gave us a local copy, not a reference to the global.</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">6	ENTER;
7	call_method("PUSH", G_SCALAR|G_DISCARD);
8	LEAVE;
</pre>
<p><code class="inline"><span class="w">ENTER</span></code> and <code class="inline"><span class="w">LEAVE</span></code> localise a block of code - they make sure that all variables are tidied up, everything that has been localised gets its previous value returned, and so on. Think of them as the <code class="inline">{</code> and <code class="inline">}</code> of a Perl block.</p> <p>To actually do the magic method call, we have to call a subroutine in Perl space: <code class="inline"><span class="w">call_method</span></code> takes care of that, and it's described in <a href="perlcall">perlcall</a>. We call the <code class="inline"><span class="w">PUSH</span></code> method in scalar context, and we're going to discard its return value. The call_method() function removes the top element of the mark stack, so there is nothing for the caller to clean up.</p> <h3 id="Save-stack">Save stack</h3> <p>C doesn't have a concept of local scope, so perl provides one. We've seen that <code class="inline"><span class="w">ENTER</span></code> and <code class="inline"><span class="w">LEAVE</span></code> are used as scoping braces; the save stack implements the C equivalent of, for example:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">{
    local $foo = 42;
    ...
}
</pre>
<p>See <a href="perlguts#Localizing-changes">Localizing changes in perlguts</a> for how to use the save stack.</p> <h2 id="MILLIONS-OF-MACROS">MILLIONS OF MACROS</h2> <p>One thing you'll notice about the Perl source is that it's full of macros. Some have called the pervasive use of macros the hardest thing to understand, others find it adds to clarity. Let's take an example, the code which implements the addition operator:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">1  PP(pp_add)
2  {
3      dSP; dATARGET; tryAMAGICbin(add,opASSIGN);
4      {
5        dPOPTOPnnrl_ul;
6        SETn( left + right );
7        RETURN;
8      }
9  }
</pre>
<p>Every line here (apart from the braces, of course) contains a macro. The first line sets up the function declaration as Perl expects for PP code; line 3 sets up variable declarations for the argument stack and the target, the return value of the operation. Finally, it tries to see if the addition operation is overloaded; if so, the appropriate subroutine is called.</p> <p>Line 5 is another variable declaration - all variable declarations start with <code class="inline"><span class="w">d</span></code> - which pops from the top of the argument stack two NVs (hence <code class="inline"><span class="w">nn</span></code> ) and puts them into the variables <code class="inline"><span class="w">right</span></code> and <code class="inline"><span class="w">left</span></code> , hence the <code class="inline"><span class="w">rl</span></code> . These are the two operands to the addition operator. Next, we call <code class="inline"><span class="w">SETn</span></code> to set the NV of the return value to the result of adding the two values. This done, we return - the <code class="inline"><span class="w">RETURN</span></code> macro makes sure that our return value is properly handled, and we pass the next operator to run back to the main run loop.</p> <p>Most of these macros are explained in <a href="perlapi">perlapi</a>, and some of the more important ones are explained in <a href="perlxs">perlxs</a> as well. Pay special attention to <a href="perlguts#Background-and-PERL_IMPLICIT_CONTEXT">Background and PERL_IMPLICIT_CONTEXT in perlguts</a> for information on the <code class="inline">[pad]THX_?</code> macros.</p> <h2 id="FURTHER-READING">FURTHER READING</h2> <p>For more information on the Perl internals, please see the documents listed at <a href="perl#Internals-and-C-Language-Interface">Internals and C Language Interface in perl</a>.</p>
