<h2 id="NAME">NAME </h2> <p>perlsyn - Perl syntax</p> <h2 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h2> <p>A Perl program consists of a sequence of declarations and statements which run from the top to the bottom. Loops, subroutines, and other control structures allow you to jump around within the code.</p> <p>Perl is a <b>free-form</b> language: you can format and indent it however you like. Whitespace serves mostly to separate tokens, unlike languages like Python where it is an important part of the syntax, or Fortran where it is immaterial.</p> <p>Many of Perl's syntactic elements are <b>optional</b>. Rather than requiring you to put parentheses around every function call and declare every variable, you can often leave such explicit elements off and Perl will figure out what you meant. This is known as <b>Do What I Mean</b>, abbreviated <b>DWIM</b>. It allows programmers to be <b>lazy</b> and to code in a style with which they are comfortable.</p> <p>Perl <b>borrows syntax</b> and concepts from many languages: awk, sed, C, Bourne Shell, Smalltalk, Lisp and even English. Other languages have borrowed syntax from Perl, particularly its regular expression extensions. So if you have programmed in another language you will see familiar pieces in Perl. They often work the same, but see <a href="perltrap">perltrap</a> for information about how they differ.</p> <h3 id="Declarations">Declarations </h3> <p>The only things you need to declare in Perl are report formats and subroutines (and sometimes not even subroutines). A scalar variable holds the undefined value (<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/undef">undef</a></code>) until it has been assigned a defined value, which is anything other than <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/undef">undef</a></code>. When used as a number, <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/undef">undef</a></code> is treated as <code class="inline"><span class="n">0</span></code> ; when used as a string, it is treated as the empty string, <code class="inline"><span class="q">""</span></code> ; and when used as a reference that isn't being assigned to, it is treated as an error. If you enable warnings, you'll be notified of an uninitialized value whenever you treat <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/undef">undef</a></code> as a string or a number. Well, usually. Boolean contexts, such as:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">if ($a) {}
</pre>
<p>are exempt from warnings (because they care about truth rather than definedness). Operators such as <code class="inline">++</code> , <code class="inline">--</code> , <code class="inline">+=</code> , <code class="inline">-=</code> , and <code class="inline">.=</code> , that operate on undefined variables such as:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">undef $a;
$a++;
</pre>
<p>are also always exempt from such warnings.</p> <p>A declaration can be put anywhere a statement can, but has no effect on the execution of the primary sequence of statements: declarations all take effect at compile time. All declarations are typically put at the beginning or the end of the script. However, if you're using lexically-scoped private variables created with <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/my">my()</a></code>, <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/state">state()</a></code>, or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/our">our()</a></code>, you'll have to make sure your format or subroutine definition is within the same block scope as the my if you expect to be able to access those private variables.</p> <p>Declaring a subroutine allows a subroutine name to be used as if it were a list operator from that point forward in the program. You can declare a subroutine without defining it by saying <code class="inline">sub <span class="m">name</span></code> , thus: </p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">sub myname;
$me = myname $0             or die "can't get myname";
</pre>
<p>A bare declaration like that declares the function to be a list operator, not a unary operator, so you have to be careful to use parentheses (or <code class="inline">or</code> instead of <code class="inline">||</code>.) The <code class="inline">||</code> operator binds too tightly to use after list operators; it becomes part of the last element. You can always use parentheses around the list operators arguments to turn the list operator back into something that behaves more like a function call. Alternatively, you can use the prototype <code class="inline"><span class="s">(</span><span class="i">$)</span></code> to turn the subroutine into a unary operator:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">sub myname ($);
$me = myname $0             || die "can't get myname";
</pre>
<p>That now parses as you'd expect, but you still ought to get in the habit of using parentheses in that situation. For more on prototypes, see <a href="perlsub">perlsub</a>.</p> <p>Subroutines declarations can also be loaded up with the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/require">require</a></code> statement or both loaded and imported into your namespace with a <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use">use</a></code> statement. See <a href="perlmod">perlmod</a> for details on this.</p> <p>A statement sequence may contain declarations of lexically-scoped variables, but apart from declaring a variable name, the declaration acts like an ordinary statement, and is elaborated within the sequence of statements as if it were an ordinary statement. That means it actually has both compile-time and run-time effects.</p> <h3 id="Comments">Comments </h3> <p>Text from a <code class="inline"><span class="q">"#"</span></code> character until the end of the line is a comment, and is ignored. Exceptions include <code class="inline"><span class="q">"#"</span></code> inside a string or regular expression.</p> <h3 id="Simple-Statements">Simple Statements </h3> <p>The only kind of simple statement is an expression evaluated for its side-effects. Every simple statement must be terminated with a semicolon, unless it is the final statement in a block, in which case the semicolon is optional. But put the semicolon in anyway if the block takes up more than one line, because you may eventually add another line. Note that there are operators like <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/eval">eval</a> <span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code> , <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/sub">sub</a> <span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code> , and <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/do">do</a> <span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code> that <i>look</i> like compound statements, but aren't--they're just TERMs in an expression--and thus need an explicit termination when used as the last item in a statement.</p> <h3 id="Truth-and-Falsehood">Truth and Falsehood </h3> <p>The number 0, the strings <code class="inline"><span class="q">'0'</span></code> and <code class="inline"><span class="q">""</span></code> , the empty list <code class="inline"><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code> , and <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/undef">undef</a></code> are all false in a boolean context. All other values are true. Negation of a true value by <code class="inline">!</code> or <code class="inline">not</code> returns a special false value. When evaluated as a string it is treated as <code class="inline"><span class="q">""</span></code> , but as a number, it is treated as 0. Most Perl operators that return true or false behave this way.</p> <h3 id="Statement-Modifiers">Statement Modifiers </h3> <p>Any simple statement may optionally be followed by a <i>SINGLE</i> modifier, just before the terminating semicolon (or block ending). The possible modifiers are:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">if EXPR
unless EXPR
while EXPR
until EXPR
for LIST
foreach LIST
when EXPR
</pre>
<p>The <code class="inline"><span class="w">EXPR</span></code> following the modifier is referred to as the "condition". Its truth or falsehood determines how the modifier will behave.</p> <p><code class="inline">if</code> executes the statement once <i>if</i> and only if the condition is true. <code class="inline">unless</code> is the opposite, it executes the statement <i>unless</i> the condition is true (that is, if the condition is false).</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">print "Basset hounds got long ears" if length $ear &gt;= 10;
go_outside() and play() unless $is_raining;
</pre>
<p>The <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/for">for(each)</a></code> modifier is an iterator: it executes the statement once for each item in the LIST (with <code class="inline"><span class="i">$_</span></code> aliased to each item in turn).</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">print "Hello $_!\n" for qw(world Dolly nurse);
</pre>
<p><code class="inline">while</code> repeats the statement <i>while</i> the condition is true. <code class="inline">until</code> does the opposite, it repeats the statement <i>until</i> the condition is true (or while the condition is false):</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl"># Both of these count from 0 to 10.
print $i++ while $i &lt;= 10;
print $j++ until $j &gt;  10;
</pre>
<p>The <code class="inline">while</code> and <code class="inline">until</code> modifiers have the usual "<code class="inline">while</code> loop" semantics (conditional evaluated first), except when applied to a <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/do">do</a></code>-BLOCK (or to the Perl4 <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/do">do</a></code>-SUBROUTINE statement), in which case the block executes once before the conditional is evaluated.</p> <p>This is so that you can write loops like:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">do {
    $line = &lt;STDIN&gt;;
    ...
} until !defined($line) || $line eq ".\n"
</pre>
<p>See <a href="functions/do">do</a>. Note also that the loop control statements described later will <i>NOT</i> work in this construct, because modifiers don't take loop labels. Sorry. You can always put another block inside of it (for <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/next">next</a></code>) or around it (for <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/last">last</a></code>) to do that sort of thing. For <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/next">next</a></code>, just double the braces: </p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">do {{
    next if $x == $y;
    # do something here
}} until $x++ &gt; $z;
</pre>
<p>For <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/last">last</a></code>, you have to be more elaborate: </p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">LOOP: {
        do {
            last if $x = $y**2;
            # do something here
        } while $x++ &lt;= $z;
}
</pre>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> The behaviour of a <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/my">my</a></code>, <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/state">state</a></code>, or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/our">our</a></code> modified with a statement modifier conditional or loop construct (for example, <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/my">my</a> <span class="i">$x</span> if ...</code> ) is <b>undefined</b>. The value of the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/my">my</a></code> variable may be <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/undef">undef</a></code>, any previously assigned value, or possibly anything else. Don't rely on it. Future versions of perl might do something different from the version of perl you try it out on. Here be dragons. </p> <p>The <code class="inline">when</code> modifier is an experimental feature that first appeared in Perl 5.14. To use it, you should include a <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use">use</a> <span class="v">v5.14</span></code> declaration. (Technically, it requires only the <code class="inline">switch</code> feature, but that aspect of it was not available before 5.14.) Operative only from within a <code class="inline">foreach</code> loop or a <code class="inline">given</code> block, it executes the statement only if the smartmatch <code class="inline">$_ ~~ <i>EXPR</i></code> is true. If the statement executes, it is followed by a <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/next">next</a></code> from inside a <code class="inline">foreach</code> and <code class="inline"><span class="w">break</span></code> from inside a <code class="inline">given</code> .</p> <p>Under the current implementation, the <code class="inline">foreach</code> loop can be anywhere within the <code class="inline">when</code> modifier's dynamic scope, but must be within the <code class="inline">given</code> block's lexical scope. This restricted may be relaxed in a future release. See <a href="#Switch-Statements">Switch Statements</a> below.</p> <h3 id="Compound-Statements">Compound Statements </h3> <p>In Perl, a sequence of statements that defines a scope is called a block. Sometimes a block is delimited by the file containing it (in the case of a required file, or the program as a whole), and sometimes a block is delimited by the extent of a string (in the case of an eval).</p> <p>But generally, a block is delimited by curly brackets, also known as braces. We will call this syntactic construct a BLOCK.</p> <p>The following compound statements may be used to control flow:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">if (EXPR) BLOCK
if (EXPR) BLOCK else BLOCK
if (EXPR) BLOCK elsif (EXPR) BLOCK ...
if (EXPR) BLOCK elsif (EXPR) BLOCK ... else BLOCK

unless (EXPR) BLOCK
unless (EXPR) BLOCK else BLOCK
unless (EXPR) BLOCK elsif (EXPR) BLOCK ...
unless (EXPR) BLOCK elsif (EXPR) BLOCK ... else BLOCK

given (EXPR) BLOCK

LABEL while (EXPR) BLOCK
LABEL while (EXPR) BLOCK continue BLOCK

LABEL until (EXPR) BLOCK
LABEL until (EXPR) BLOCK continue BLOCK

LABEL for (EXPR; EXPR; EXPR) BLOCK
LABEL for VAR (LIST) BLOCK
LABEL for VAR (LIST) BLOCK continue BLOCK

LABEL foreach (EXPR; EXPR; EXPR) BLOCK
LABEL foreach VAR (LIST) BLOCK
LABEL foreach VAR (LIST) BLOCK continue BLOCK

LABEL BLOCK
LABEL BLOCK continue BLOCK

PHASE BLOCK
</pre>
<p>The experimental <code class="inline">given</code> statement is <i>not automatically enabled</i>; see <a href="#Switch-Statements">Switch Statements</a> below for how to do so, and the attendant caveats.</p> <p>Unlike in C and Pascal, in Perl these are all defined in terms of BLOCKs, not statements. This means that the curly brackets are <i>required</i>--no dangling statements allowed. If you want to write conditionals without curly brackets, there are several other ways to do it. The following all do the same thing:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">if (!open(FOO)) { die "Can't open $FOO: $!" }
die "Can't open $FOO: $!" unless open(FOO);
open(FOO)  || die "Can't open $FOO: $!";
open(FOO) ? () : die "Can't open $FOO: $!";
    # a bit exotic, that last one
</pre>
<p>The <code class="inline">if</code> statement is straightforward. Because BLOCKs are always bounded by curly brackets, there is never any ambiguity about which <code class="inline">if</code> an <code class="inline">else</code> goes with. If you use <code class="inline">unless</code> in place of <code class="inline">if</code> , the sense of the test is reversed. Like <code class="inline">if</code> , <code class="inline">unless</code> can be followed by <code class="inline">else</code> . <code class="inline">unless</code> can even be followed by one or more <code class="inline">elsif</code> statements, though you may want to think twice before using that particular language construct, as everyone reading your code will have to think at least twice before they can understand what's going on.</p> <p>The <code class="inline">while</code> statement executes the block as long as the expression is <a href="#Truth-and-Falsehood">true</a>. The <code class="inline">until</code> statement executes the block as long as the expression is false. The LABEL is optional, and if present, consists of an identifier followed by a colon. The LABEL identifies the loop for the loop control statements <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/next">next</a></code>, <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/last">last</a></code>, and <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/redo">redo</a></code>. If the LABEL is omitted, the loop control statement refers to the innermost enclosing loop. This may include dynamically looking back your call-stack at run time to find the LABEL. Such desperate behavior triggers a warning if you use the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use">use</a> <span class="w">warnings</span></code> pragma or the <b>-w</b> flag.</p> <p>If there is a <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/continue">continue</a></code> BLOCK, it is always executed just before the conditional is about to be evaluated again. Thus it can be used to increment a loop variable, even when the loop has been continued via the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/next">next</a></code> statement.</p> <p>When a block is preceding by a compilation phase keyword such as <code class="inline">BEGIN</code> , <code class="inline">END</code> , <code class="inline">INIT</code> , <code class="inline">CHECK</code> , or <code class="inline">UNITCHECK</code> , then the block will run only during the corresponding phase of execution. See <a href="perlmod">perlmod</a> for more details.</p> <p>Extension modules can also hook into the Perl parser to define new kinds of compound statements. These are introduced by a keyword which the extension recognizes, and the syntax following the keyword is defined entirely by the extension. If you are an implementor, see <a href="perlapi#PL_keyword_plugin">PL_keyword_plugin in perlapi</a> for the mechanism. If you are using such a module, see the module's documentation for details of the syntax that it defines.</p> <h3 id="Loop-Control">Loop Control </h3> <p>The <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/next">next</a></code> command starts the next iteration of the loop:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">LINE: while (&lt;STDIN&gt;) {
    next LINE if /^#/;      # discard comments
    ...
}
</pre>
<p>The <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/last">last</a></code> command immediately exits the loop in question. The <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/continue">continue</a></code> block, if any, is not executed:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">LINE: while (&lt;STDIN&gt;) {
    last LINE if /^$/;      # exit when done with header
    ...
}
</pre>
<p>The <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/redo">redo</a></code> command restarts the loop block without evaluating the conditional again. The <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/continue">continue</a></code> block, if any, is <i>not</i> executed. This command is normally used by programs that want to lie to themselves about what was just input.</p> <p>For example, when processing a file like <i>/etc/termcap</i>. If your input lines might end in backslashes to indicate continuation, you want to skip ahead and get the next record.</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">while (&lt;&gt;) {
    chomp;
    if (s/\\$//) {
        $_ .= &lt;&gt;;
        redo unless eof();
    }
    # now process $_
}
</pre>
<p>which is Perl shorthand for the more explicitly written version:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">LINE: while (defined($line = &lt;ARGV&gt;)) {
    chomp($line);
    if ($line =~ s/\\$//) {
        $line .= &lt;ARGV&gt;;
        redo LINE unless eof(); # not eof(ARGV)!
    }
    # now process $line
}
</pre>
<p>Note that if there were a <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/continue">continue</a></code> block on the above code, it would get executed only on lines discarded by the regex (since redo skips the continue block). A continue block is often used to reset line counters or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/m">m?pat?</a></code> one-time matches:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl"># inspired by :1,$g/fred/s//WILMA/
while (&lt;&gt;) {
    m?(fred)?    &amp;&amp; s//WILMA $1 WILMA/;
    m?(barney)?  &amp;&amp; s//BETTY $1 BETTY/;
    m?(homer)?   &amp;&amp; s//MARGE $1 MARGE/;
} continue {
    print "$ARGV $.: $_";
    close ARGV  if eof;             # reset $.
    reset       if eof;             # reset ?pat?
}
</pre>
<p>If the word <code class="inline">while</code> is replaced by the word <code class="inline">until</code> , the sense of the test is reversed, but the conditional is still tested before the first iteration.</p> <p>Loop control statements don't work in an <code class="inline">if</code> or <code class="inline">unless</code> , since they aren't loops. You can double the braces to make them such, though.</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">if (/pattern/) {{
    last if /fred/;
    next if /barney/; # same effect as "last",
                      # but doesn't document as well
    # do something here

<p>This is caused by the fact that a block by itself acts as a loop that executes once, see <a href="#Basic-BLOCKs">Basic BLOCKs</a>.</p> <p>The form <code class="inline">while/if BLOCK BLOCK</code>, available in Perl 4, is no longer available. Replace any occurrence of <code class="inline">if <span class="w">BLOCK</span></code> by <code class="inline">if <span class="s">(</span><a class="l_k" href="functions/do">do</a> <span class="w">BLOCK</span><span class="s">)</span></code> .</p> <h3 id="For-Loops">For Loops </h3> <p>Perl's C-style <code class="inline">for</code> loop works like the corresponding <code class="inline">while</code> loop; that means that this:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">for ($i = 1; $i &lt; 10; $i++) {

while ($i &lt; 10) {

</pre>
<p>There is one minor difference: if variables are declared with <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/my">my</a></code> in the initialization section of the <code class="inline">for</code> , the lexical scope of those variables is exactly the <code class="inline">for</code> loop (the body of the loop and the control sections). </p> <p>As a special case, if the test in the <code class="inline">for</code> loop (or the corresponding <code class="inline">while</code> loop) is empty, it is treated as true. That is, both</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">for (;;) {
    ...

</pre>
<p>and</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">while () {
    ...

</pre>
<p>are treated as infinite loops.</p> <p>Besides the normal array index looping, <code class="inline">for</code> can lend itself to many other interesting applications. Here's one that avoids the problem you get into if you explicitly test for end-of-file on an interactive file descriptor causing your program to appear to hang. </p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">$on_a_tty = -t STDIN &amp;&amp; -t STDOUT;

This behaviour is the same as a <code class="inline">while</code> loop conditional. </p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">for ( prompt(); defined( $_ = &lt;STDIN&gt; ); prompt() ) {

<h3 id="Foreach-Loops">Foreach Loops </h3> <p>The <code class="inline">foreach</code> loop iterates over a normal list value and sets the scalar variable VAR to be each element of the list in turn. If the variable is preceded with the keyword <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/my">my</a></code>, then it is lexically scoped, and is therefore visible only within the loop. Otherwise, the variable is implicitly local to the loop and regains its former value upon exiting the loop. If the variable was previously declared with <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/my">my</a></code>, it uses that variable instead of the global one, but it's still localized to the loop. This implicit localization occurs <i>only</i> in a <code class="inline">foreach</code> loop. </p> <p>The <code class="inline">foreach</code> keyword is actually a synonym for the <code class="inline">for</code> keyword, so you can use either. If VAR is omitted, <code class="inline"><span class="i">$_</span></code> is set to each value. </p> <p>If any element of LIST is an lvalue, you can modify it by modifying VAR inside the loop. Conversely, if any element of LIST is NOT an lvalue, any attempt to modify that element will fail. In other words, the <code class="inline">foreach</code> loop index variable is an implicit alias for each item in the list that you're looping over. </p> <p>If any part of LIST is an array, <code class="inline">foreach</code> will get very confused if you add or remove elements within the loop body, for example with <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/splice">splice</a></code>. So don't do that. </p> <p><code class="inline">foreach</code> probably won't do what you expect if VAR is a tied or other special variable. Don't do that either.</p> <p>As of Perl 5.22, there is an experimental variant of this loop that accepts a variable preceded by a backslash for VAR, in which case the items in the LIST must be references. The backslashed variable will become an alias to each referenced item in the LIST, which must be of the correct type. The variable needn't be a scalar in this case, and the backslash may be followed by <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/my">my</a></code>. To use this form, you must enable the <code class="inline"><span class="w">refaliasing</span></code> feature via <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use">use</a> <span class="w">feature</span></code> . (See <a href="feature">feature</a>. See also <a href="perlref#Assigning-to-References">Assigning to References in perlref</a>.)</p> <p>Examples:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">for (@ary) { s/foo/bar/ }

for my $elem (@elements) {
    $elem *= 2;
}

for $count (reverse(1..10), "BOOM") {
    print $count, "\n";
    sleep(1);
}

for (1..15) { print "Merry Christmas\n"; }

foreach $item (split(/:[\\\n:]*/, $ENV{TERMCAP})) {
    print "Item: $item\n";
}

use feature "refaliasing";
no warnings "experimental::refaliasing";
foreach \my %hash (@array_of_hash_references) {
    # do something which each %hash
}
</pre>
<p>Here's how a C programmer might code up a particular algorithm in Perl:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">for (my $i = 0; $i &lt; @ary1; $i++) {
    for (my $j = 0; $j &lt; @ary2; $j++) {
        if ($ary1[$i] &gt; $ary2[$j]) {
            last; # can't go to outer :-(
        }
        $ary1[$i] += $ary2[$j];
    }
    # this is where that last takes me
}
</pre>
<p>Whereas here's how a Perl programmer more comfortable with the idiom might do it:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">OUTER: for my $wid (@ary1) {
INNER:   for my $jet (@ary2) {
            next OUTER if $wid &gt; $jet;
            $wid += $jet;
         }
      }
</pre>
<p>See how much easier this is? It's cleaner, safer, and faster. It's cleaner because it's less noisy. It's safer because if code gets added between the inner and outer loops later on, the new code won't be accidentally executed. The <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/next">next</a></code> explicitly iterates the other loop rather than merely terminating the inner one. And it's faster because Perl executes a <code class="inline">foreach</code> statement more rapidly than it would the equivalent <code class="inline">for</code> loop.</p> <p>Perceptive Perl hackers may have noticed that a <code class="inline">for</code> loop has a return value, and that this value can be captured by wrapping the loop in a <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/do">do</a></code> block. The reward for this discovery is this cautionary advice: The return value of a <code class="inline">for</code> loop is unspecified and may change without notice. Do not rely on it.</p> <h3 id="Basic-BLOCKs">Basic BLOCKs </h3> <p>A BLOCK by itself (labeled or not) is semantically equivalent to a loop that executes once. Thus you can use any of the loop control statements in it to leave or restart the block. (Note that this is <i>NOT</i> true in <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/eval">eval{}</a></code>, <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/sub">sub{}</a></code>, or contrary to popular belief <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/do">do{}</a></code> blocks, which do <i>NOT</i> count as loops.) The <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/continue">continue</a></code> block is optional.</p> <p>The BLOCK construct can be used to emulate case structures.</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">SWITCH: {
    if (/^abc/) { $abc = 1; last SWITCH; }
    if (/^def/) { $def = 1; last SWITCH; }
    if (/^xyz/) { $xyz = 1; last SWITCH; }
    $nothing = 1;
}
</pre>
<p>You'll also find that <code class="inline">foreach</code> loop used to create a topicalizer and a switch:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">SWITCH:
for ($var) {
    if (/^abc/) { $abc = 1; last SWITCH; }
    if (/^def/) { $def = 1; last SWITCH; }
    if (/^xyz/) { $xyz = 1; last SWITCH; }
    $nothing = 1;
}
</pre>
<p>Such constructs are quite frequently used, both because older versions of Perl had no official <code class="inline">switch</code> statement, and also because the new version described immediately below remains experimental and can sometimes be confusing.</p> <h3 id="Switch-Statements">Switch Statements</h3>  <p>Starting from Perl 5.10.1 (well, 5.10.0, but it didn't work right), you can say</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">use feature "switch";
</pre>
<p>to enable an experimental switch feature. This is loosely based on an old version of a Perl 6 proposal, but it no longer resembles the Perl 6 construct. You also get the switch feature whenever you declare that your code prefers to run under a version of Perl that is 5.10 or later. For example:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">use v5.14;
</pre>
<p>Under the "switch" feature, Perl gains the experimental keywords <code class="inline">given</code> , <code class="inline">when</code> , <code class="inline"><span class="w">default</span></code> , <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/continue">continue</a></code>, and <code class="inline"><span class="w">break</span></code> . Starting from Perl 5.16, one can prefix the switch keywords with <code class="inline"><span class="w">CORE::</span></code> to access the feature without a <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use">use</a> <span class="w">feature</span></code> statement. The keywords <code class="inline">given</code> and <code class="inline">when</code> are analogous to <code class="inline">switch</code> and <code class="inline">case</code> in other languages, so the code in the previous section could be rewritten as</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">use v5.10.1;
for ($var) {
    when (/^abc/) { $abc = 1 }
    when (/^def/) { $def = 1 }
    when (/^xyz/) { $xyz = 1 }
    default       { $nothing = 1 }
}
</pre>
<p>The <code class="inline">foreach</code> is the non-experimental way to set a topicalizer. If you wish to use the highly experimental <code class="inline">given</code> , that could be written like this:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">use v5.10.1;
given ($var) {
    when (/^abc/) { $abc = 1 }
    when (/^def/) { $def = 1 }
    when (/^xyz/) { $xyz = 1 }
    default       { $nothing = 1 }
}
</pre>
<p>As of 5.14, that can also be written this way:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">use v5.14;
for ($var) {
    $abc = 1 when /^abc/;
    $def = 1 when /^def/;
    $xyz = 1 when /^xyz/;
    default { $nothing = 1 }
}
</pre>
<p>Or if you don't care to play it safe, like this:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">use v5.14;
given ($var) {
    $abc = 1 when /^abc/;
    $def = 1 when /^def/;
    $xyz = 1 when /^xyz/;
    default { $nothing = 1 }
}
</pre>
<p>The arguments to <code class="inline">given</code> and <code class="inline">when</code> are in scalar context, and <code class="inline">given</code> assigns the <code class="inline"><span class="i">$_</span></code> variable its topic value.</p> <p>Exactly what the <i>EXPR</i> argument to <code class="inline">when</code> does is hard to describe precisely, but in general, it tries to guess what you want done. Sometimes it is interpreted as <code class="inline">$_ ~~ <i>EXPR</i></code>, and sometimes it is not. It also behaves differently when lexically enclosed by a <code class="inline">given</code> block than it does when dynamically enclosed by a <code class="inline">foreach</code> loop. The rules are far too difficult to understand to be described here. See <a href="#Experimental-Details-on-given-and-when">Experimental Details on given and when</a> later on.</p> <p>Due to an unfortunate bug in how <code class="inline">given</code> was implemented between Perl 5.10 and 5.16, under those implementations the version of <code class="inline"><span class="i">$_</span></code> governed by <code class="inline">given</code> is merely a lexically scoped copy of the original, not a dynamically scoped alias to the original, as it would be if it were a <code class="inline">foreach</code> or under both the original and the current Perl 6 language specification. This bug was fixed in Perl 5.18. If you really want a lexical <code class="inline"><span class="i">$_</span></code> , specify that explicitly, but note that <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/my">my</a> <span class="i">$_</span></code> is now deprecated and will warn unless warnings have been disabled:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">given(my $_ = EXPR) { ... }
</pre>
<p>If your code still needs to run on older versions, stick to <code class="inline">foreach</code> for your topicalizer and you will be less unhappy.</p> <h3 id="Goto">Goto </h3> <p>Although not for the faint of heart, Perl does support a <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/goto">goto</a></code> statement. There are three forms: <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/goto">goto</a></code>-LABEL, <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/goto">goto</a></code>-EXPR, and <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/goto">goto</a></code>-&amp;NAME. A loop's LABEL is not actually a valid target for a <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/goto">goto</a></code>; it's just the name of the loop.</p> <p>The <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/goto">goto</a></code>-LABEL form finds the statement labeled with LABEL and resumes execution there. It may not be used to go into any construct that requires initialization, such as a subroutine or a <code class="inline">foreach</code> loop. It also can't be used to go into a construct that is optimized away. It can be used to go almost anywhere else within the dynamic scope, including out of subroutines, but it's usually better to use some other construct such as <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/last">last</a></code> or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/die">die</a></code>. The author of Perl has never felt the need to use this form of <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/goto">goto</a></code> (in Perl, that is--C is another matter).</p> <p>The <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/goto">goto</a></code>-EXPR form expects a label name, whose scope will be resolved dynamically. This allows for computed <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/goto">goto</a></code>s per FORTRAN, but isn't necessarily recommended if you're optimizing for maintainability:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">goto(("FOO", "BAR", "GLARCH")[$i]);
</pre>
<p>The <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/goto">goto</a></code>-&amp;NAME form is highly magical, and substitutes a call to the named subroutine for the currently running subroutine. This is used by <code class="inline">AUTOLOAD<span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code> subroutines that wish to load another subroutine and then pretend that the other subroutine had been called in the first place (except that any modifications to <code class="inline"><span class="i">@_</span></code> in the current subroutine are propagated to the other subroutine.) After the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/goto">goto</a></code>, not even <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/caller">caller()</a></code> will be able to tell that this routine was called first.</p> <p>In almost all cases like this, it's usually a far, far better idea to use the structured control flow mechanisms of <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/next">next</a></code>, <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/last">last</a></code>, or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/redo">redo</a></code> instead of resorting to a <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/goto">goto</a></code>. For certain applications, the catch and throw pair of <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/eval">eval{}</a></code> and die() for exception processing can also be a prudent approach.</p> <h3 id="The-Ellipsis-Statement">The Ellipsis Statement </h3> <p>Beginning in Perl 5.12, Perl accepts an ellipsis, "<code class="inline">...</code> ", as a placeholder for code that you haven't implemented yet. This form of ellipsis, the unimplemented statement, should not be confused with the binary flip-flop <code class="inline">...</code> operator. One is a statement and the other an operator. (Perl doesn't usually confuse them because usually Perl can tell whether it wants an operator or a statement, but see below for exceptions.)</p> <p>When Perl 5.12 or later encounters an ellipsis statement, it parses this without error, but if and when you should actually try to execute it, Perl throws an exception with the text <code class="inline"><span class="w">Unimplemented</span></code> :</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">use v5.12;
sub unimplemented { ... }
eval { unimplemented() };
if ($@ =~ /^Unimplemented at /) {
    say "I found an ellipsis!";
}
</pre>
<p>You can only use the elliptical statement to stand in for a complete statement. These examples of how the ellipsis works:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">use v5.12;
{ ... }
sub foo { ... }
...;
eval { ... };
sub somemeth {
    my $self = shift;
    ...;
}
$x = do {
    my $n;
    ...;
    say "Hurrah!";
    $n;
};
</pre>
<p>The elliptical statement cannot stand in for an expression that is part of a larger statement, since the <code class="inline">...</code> is also the three-dot version of the flip-flop operator (see <a href="perlop#Range-Operators">Range Operators in perlop</a>).</p> <p>These examples of attempts to use an ellipsis are syntax errors:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">use v5.12;

print ...;
open(my $fh, "&gt;", "/dev/passwd") or ...;
if ($condition &amp;&amp; ... ) { say "Howdy" };
</pre>
<p>There are some cases where Perl can't immediately tell the difference between an expression and a statement. For instance, the syntax for a block and an anonymous hash reference constructor look the same unless there's something in the braces to give Perl a hint. The ellipsis is a syntax error if Perl doesn't guess that the <code class="inline"><span class="s">{</span> ... <span class="s">}</span></code> is a block. In that case, it doesn't think the <code class="inline">...</code> is an ellipsis because it's expecting an expression instead of a statement:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">@transformed = map { ... } @input;    # syntax error
</pre>
<p>Inside your block, you can use a <code class="inline"><span class="sc">;</span></code> before the ellipsis to denote that the <code class="inline"><span class="s">{</span> ... <span class="s">}</span></code> is a block and not a hash reference constructor. Now the ellipsis works:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">@transformed = map {; ... } @input;   # ';' disambiguates
</pre>
<p>Note: Some folks colloquially refer to this bit of punctuation as a "yada-yada" or "triple-dot", but its true name is actually an ellipsis.</p> <h3 id="PODs%3a-Embedded-Documentation">PODs: Embedded Documentation </h3> <p>Perl has a mechanism for intermixing documentation with source code. While it's expecting the beginning of a new statement, if the compiler encounters a line that begins with an equal sign and a word, like this</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">=head1 Here There Be Pods!
</pre>
<p>Then that text and all remaining text up through and including a line beginning with <code class="inline"><span class="pd">=cut</span></code> will be ignored. The format of the intervening text is described in <a href="perlpod">perlpod</a>.</p> <p>This allows you to intermix your source code and your documentation text freely, as in</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">=item snazzle($)

The snazzle() function will behave in the most spectacular
form that you can possibly imagine, not even excepting
cybernetic pyrotechnics.

=cut back to the compiler, nuff of this pod stuff!

sub snazzle($) {
    my $thingie = shift;
    .........
}
</pre>
<p>Note that pod translators should look at only paragraphs beginning with a pod directive (it makes parsing easier), whereas the compiler actually knows to look for pod escapes even in the middle of a paragraph. This means that the following secret stuff will be ignored by both the compiler and the translators.</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">$a=3;
=secret stuff
 warn "Neither POD nor CODE!?"
=cut back
print "got $a\n";
</pre>
<p>You probably shouldn't rely upon the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/warn">warn()</a></code> being podded out forever. Not all pod translators are well-behaved in this regard, and perhaps the compiler will become pickier.</p> <p>One may also use pod directives to quickly comment out a section of code.</p> <h3 id="Plain-Old-Comments-(Not!)">Plain Old Comments (Not!) </h3> <p>Perl can process line directives, much like the C preprocessor. Using this, one can control Perl's idea of filenames and line numbers in error or warning messages (especially for strings that are processed with <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/eval">eval()</a></code>). The syntax for this mechanism is almost the same as for most C preprocessors: it matches the regular expression</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl"># example: '# line 42 "new_filename.plx"'
/^\#   \s*
        line \s+ (\d+)   \s*
        (?:\s("?)([^"]+)\g2)? \s*
      $/x
</pre>
<p>with <code class="inline"><span class="i">$1</span></code> being the line number for the next line, and <code class="inline"><span class="i">$3</span></code> being the optional filename (specified with or without quotes). Note that no whitespace may precede the <code class="inline"><span class="c">#</span></code> , unlike modern C preprocessors.</p> <p>There is a fairly obvious gotcha included with the line directive: Debuggers and profilers will only show the last source line to appear at a particular line number in a given file. Care should be taken not to cause line number collisions in code you'd like to debug later.</p> <p>Here are some examples that you should be able to type into your command shell:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">% perl
# line 200 "bzzzt"
# the '#' on the previous line must be the first char on line
die 'foo';
__END__
foo at bzzzt line 201.

eval qq[\n#line 2001 ""\ndie 'foo']; print $@;

<h3 id="Experimental-Details-on-given-and-when">Experimental Details on given and when</h3> <p>As previously mentioned, the "switch" feature is considered highly experimental; it is subject to change with little notice. In particular, <code class="inline">when</code> has tricky behaviours that are expected to change to become less tricky in the future. Do not rely upon its current (mis)implementation. Before Perl 5.18, <code class="inline">given</code> also had tricky behaviours that you should still beware of if your code must run on older versions of Perl.</p> <p>Here is a longer example of <code class="inline">given</code> :</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">use feature ":5.10";

</pre>
<p>Before Perl 5.18, <code class="inline">given<span class="s">(</span><span class="w">EXPR</span><span class="s">)</span></code> assigned the value of <i>EXPR</i> to merely a lexically scoped <i><b>copy</b></i> (!) of <code class="inline"><span class="i">$_</span></code> , not a dynamically scoped alias the way <code class="inline">foreach</code> does. That made it similar to</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">do { my $_ = EXPR; ... }
</pre>
<p>except that the block was automatically broken out of by a successful <code class="inline">when</code> or an explicit <code class="inline"><span class="w">break</span></code> . Because it was only a copy, and because it was only lexically scoped, not dynamically scoped, you could not do the things with it that you are used to in a <code class="inline">foreach</code> loop. In particular, it did not work for arbitrary function calls if those functions might try to access $_. Best stick to <code class="inline">foreach</code> for that.</p> <p>Most of the power comes from the implicit smartmatching that can sometimes apply. Most of the time, <code class="inline">when<span class="s">(</span><span class="w">EXPR</span><span class="s">)</span></code> is treated as an implicit smartmatch of <code class="inline"><span class="i">$_</span></code> , that is, <code class="inline"><span class="i">$_</span> ~~ <span class="w">EXPR</span></code> . (See <a href="perlop#Smartmatch-Operator">Smartmatch Operator in perlop</a> for more information on smartmatching.) But when <i>EXPR</i> is one of the 10 exceptional cases (or things like them) listed below, it is used directly as a boolean.</p> <ul> <li id="1.">

<b>2.</b> <p>A regular expression match in the form of <code class="inline"><span class="q">/REGEX/</span></code> , <code class="inline"><span class="i">$foo</span> =~ <span class="q">/REGEX/</span></code> , or <code class="inline"><span class="i">$foo</span> =~ <span class="w">EXPR</span></code> . Also, a negated regular expression match in the form <code class="inline">!<span class="q">/REGEX/</span></code> , <code class="inline"><span class="i">$foo</span> !~ <span class="q">/REGEX/</span></code> , or <code class="inline"><span class="i">$foo</span> !~ <span class="w">EXPR</span></code> .</p> </li> <li id="3.">
<b>3.</b> <p>A smart match that uses an explicit <code class="inline">~~</code> operator, such as <code class="inline"><span class="w">EXPR</span> ~~ <span class="w">EXPR</span></code> .</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b> You will often have to use <code class="inline"><span class="i">$c</span> ~~ <span class="i">$_</span></code> because the default case uses <code class="inline"><span class="i">$_</span> ~~ <span class="i">$c</span></code> , which is frequentlythe opposite of what you want.</p> </li> <li id="4.">
<b>4.</b> <p>A boolean comparison operator such as <code class="inline"><span class="i">$_</span> &lt; <span class="n">10</span></code> or <code class="inline"><span class="i">$x</span> eq <span class="q">"abc"</span></code> . The relational operators that this applies to are the six numeric comparisons (<code class="inline">&lt;</code> , <code class="inline">&gt;</code>, <code class="inline">&lt;=</code> , <code class="inline">&gt;=</code> , <code class="inline">==</code> , and <code class="inline">!=</code> ), and the six string comparisons (<code class="inline">lt</code> , <code class="inline">gt</code> , <code class="inline">le</code> , <code class="inline">ge</code> , <code class="inline">eq</code> , and <code class="inline">ne</code> ).</p> </li> <li id="5.">
<b>5.</b> <p>At least the three builtin functions <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/defined">defined(...)</a></code>, <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/exists">exists(...)</a></code>, and <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/eof">eof(...)</a></code>. We might someday add more of these later if we think of them.</p> </li> <li id="6.">
<b>6.</b> <p>A negated expression, whether <code class="inline">!<span class="s">(</span><span class="w">EXPR</span><span class="s">)</span></code> or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/not">not(EXPR)</a></code>, or a logical exclusive-or, <code class="inline"><span class="s">(</span><span class="w">EXPR1</span><span class="s">)</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/xor">xor</a> <span class="s">(</span><span class="w">EXPR2</span><span class="s">)</span></code> . The bitwise versions (<code class="inline">~</code> and <code class="inline">^</code>) are not included.</p> </li> <li id="7.">
<b>7.</b> <p>A filetest operator, with exactly 4 exceptions: <code class="inline">-s</code> , <code class="inline">-M</code> , <code class="inline">-A</code> , and <code class="inline">-C</code> , as these return numerical values, not boolean ones. The <code class="inline">-z</code> filetest operator is not included in the exception list.</p> </li> <li id="8.">
<b>8.</b> <p>The <code class="inline">..</code> and <code class="inline">...</code> flip-flop operators. Note that the <code class="inline">...</code> flip-flop operator is completely different from the <code class="inline">...</code> elliptical statement just described.</p> </li> </ul> <p>In those 8 cases above, the value of EXPR is used directly as a boolean, so no smartmatching is done. You may think of <code class="inline">when</code> as a smartsmartmatch.</p> <p>Furthermore, Perl inspects the operands of logical operators to decide whether to use smartmatching for each one by applying the above test to the operands:</p> <ul> <li id="9.">
<b>9.</b> <p>If EXPR is <code class="inline"><span class="w">EXPR1</span> &amp;&amp; <span class="w">EXPR2</span></code> or <code class="inline"><span class="w">EXPR1</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/and">and</a> <span class="w">EXPR2</span></code> , the test is applied <i>recursively</i> to both EXPR1 and EXPR2. Only if <i>both</i> operands also pass the test, <i>recursively</i>, will the expression be treated as boolean. Otherwise, smartmatching is used.</p> </li> <li id="10.">
<b>10.</b> <p>If EXPR is <code class="inline"><span class="w">EXPR1</span> || <span class="w">EXPR2</span></code> , <code class="inline"><span class="w">EXPR1</span> <span class="q">//</span> <span class="w">EXPR2</span></code> , or <code class="inline"><span class="w">EXPR1</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/or">or</a> <span class="w">EXPR2</span></code> , the test is applied <i>recursively</i> to EXPR1 only (which might itself be a higher-precedence AND operator, for example, and thus subject to the previous rule), not to EXPR2. If EXPR1 is to use smartmatching, then EXPR2 also does so, no matter what EXPR2 contains. But if EXPR2 does not get to use smartmatching, then the second argument will not be either. This is quite different from the <code class="inline">&amp;&amp;</code> case just described, so be careful.</p> </li> </ul> <p>These rules are complicated, but the goal is for them to do what you want (even if you don't quite understand why they are doing it). For example:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">when (/^\d+$/ &amp;&amp; $_ &lt; 75) { ... }
</pre>
<p>will be treated as a boolean match because the rules say both a regex match and an explicit test on <code class="inline"><span class="i">$_</span></code> will be treated as boolean.</p> <p>Also:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">when ([qw(foo bar)] &amp;&amp; /baz/) { ... }
</pre>
<p>will use smartmatching because only <i>one</i> of the operands is a boolean: the other uses smartmatching, and that wins.</p> <p>Further:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">when ([qw(foo bar)] || /^baz/) { ... }
</pre>
<p>will use smart matching (only the first operand is considered), whereas</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">when (/^baz/ || [qw(foo bar)]) { ... }
</pre>
<p>will test only the regex, which causes both operands to be treated as boolean. Watch out for this one, then, because an arrayref is always a true value, which makes it effectively redundant. Not a good idea.</p> <p>Tautologous boolean operators are still going to be optimized away. Don't be tempted to write</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">when ("foo" or "bar") { ... }
</pre>
<p>This will optimize down to <code class="inline"><span class="q">"foo"</span></code> , so <code class="inline"><span class="q">"bar"</span></code> will never be considered (even though the rules say to use a smartmatch on <code class="inline"><span class="q">"foo"</span></code> ). For an alternation like this, an array ref will work, because this will instigate smartmatching:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">when ([qw(foo bar)] { ... }
</pre>
<p>This is somewhat equivalent to the C-style switch statement's fallthrough functionality (not to be confused with <i>Perl's</i> fallthrough functionality--see below), wherein the same block is used for several <code class="inline">case</code> statements.</p> <p>Another useful shortcut is that, if you use a literal array or hash as the argument to <code class="inline">given</code> , it is turned into a reference. So <code class="inline">given<span class="s">(</span><span class="i">@foo</span><span class="s">)</span></code> is the same as <code class="inline">given<span class="s">(</span>\<span class="i">@foo</span><span class="s">)</span></code> , for example.</p> <p><code class="inline"><span class="w">default</span></code> behaves exactly like <code class="inline">when<span class="s">(</span><span class="n">1</span> == <span class="n">1</span><span class="s">)</span></code> , which is to say that it always matches.</p> <h4 id="Breaking-out">Breaking out</h4> <p>You can use the <code class="inline"><span class="w">break</span></code> keyword to break out of the enclosing <code class="inline">given</code> block. Every <code class="inline">when</code> block is implicitly ended with a <code class="inline"><span class="w">break</span></code> .</p> <h4 id="Fall-through">Fall-through</h4> <p>You can use the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/continue">continue</a></code> keyword to fall through from one case to the next:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">given($foo) {
    when (/x/) { say '$foo contains an x'; continue }
    when (/y/) { say '$foo contains a y'            }
    default    { say '$foo does not contain a y'    }
}
</pre>
<h4 id="Return-value">Return value</h4> <p>When a <code class="inline">given</code> statement is also a valid expression (for example, when it's the last statement of a block), it evaluates to:</p> <ul> <li> <p>An empty list as soon as an explicit <code class="inline"><span class="w">break</span></code> is encountered.</p> </li> <li> <p>The value of the last evaluated expression of the successful <code class="inline">when</code> /<code class="inline"><span class="w">default</span></code> clause, if there happens to be one.</p> </li> <li> <p>The value of the last evaluated expression of the <code class="inline">given</code> block if no condition is true.</p> </li> </ul> <p>In both last cases, the last expression is evaluated in the context that was applied to the <code class="inline">given</code> block.</p> <p>Note that, unlike <code class="inline">if</code> and <code class="inline">unless</code> , failed <code class="inline">when</code> statements always evaluate to an empty list.</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">my $price = do {
    given ($item) {
        when (["pear", "apple"]) { 1 }
        break when "vote";      # My vote cannot be bought
        1e10  when /Mona Lisa/;
        "unknown";
    }
};
</pre>
<p>Currently, <code class="inline">given</code> blocks can't always be used as proper expressions. This may be addressed in a future version of Perl.</p> <h4 id="Switching-in-a-loop">Switching in a loop</h4> <p>Instead of using <code class="inline">given<span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code> , you can use a <code class="inline">foreach<span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code> loop. For example, here's one way to count how many times a particular string occurs in an array:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">use v5.10.1;
my $count = 0;
for (@array) {
    when ("foo") { ++$count }
}
print "\@array contains $count copies of 'foo'\n";
</pre>
<p>Or in a more recent version:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">use v5.14;
my $count = 0;
for (@array) {
    ++$count when "foo";
}
print "\@array contains $count copies of 'foo'\n";
</pre>
<p>At the end of all <code class="inline">when</code> blocks, there is an implicit <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/next">next</a></code>. You can override that with an explicit <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/last">last</a></code> if you're interested in only the first match alone.</p> <p>This doesn't work if you explicitly specify a loop variable, as in <code class="inline">for <span class="i">$item</span> <span class="s">(</span><span class="i">@array</span><span class="s">)</span></code> . You have to use the default variable <code class="inline"><span class="i">$_</span></code> .</p> <h4 id="Differences-from-Perl-6">Differences from Perl 6</h4> <p>The Perl 5 smartmatch and <code class="inline">given</code> /<code class="inline">when</code> constructs are not compatible with their Perl 6 analogues. The most visible difference and least important difference is that, in Perl 5, parentheses are required around the argument to <code class="inline">given<span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code> and <code class="inline">when<span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code> (except when this last one is used as a statement modifier). Parentheses in Perl 6 are always optional in a control construct such as <code class="inline">if<span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code> , <code class="inline">while<span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code> , or <code class="inline">when<span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code> ; they can't be made optional in Perl 5 without a great deal of potential confusion, because Perl 5 would parse the expression</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">given $foo {
    ...
}
</pre>
<p>as though the argument to <code class="inline">given</code> were an element of the hash <code class="inline"><span class="i">%foo</span></code> , interpreting the braces as hash-element syntax.</p> <p>However, their are many, many other differences. For example, this works in Perl 5:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">use v5.12;
my @primary = ("red", "blue", "green");

if (@primary ~~ "red") {
    say "primary smartmatches red";
}

if ("red" ~~ @primary) {
    say "red smartmatches primary";
}

say "that's all, folks!";
</pre>
<p>But it doesn't work at all in Perl 6. Instead, you should use the (parallelizable) <code class="inline"><span class="w">any</span></code> operator:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">if any(@primary) eq "red" {
    say "primary smartmatches red";
}

if "red" eq any(@primary) {
    say "red smartmatches primary";
}
</pre>
<p>The table of smartmatches in <a href="perlop#Smartmatch-Operator">Smartmatch Operator in perlop</a> is not identical to that proposed by the Perl 6 specification, mainly due to differences between Perl 6's and Perl 5's data models, but also because the Perl 6 spec has changed since Perl 5 rushed into early adoption.</p> <p>In Perl 6, <code class="inline">when<span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code> will always do an implicit smartmatch with its argument, while in Perl 5 it is convenient (albeit potentially confusing) to suppress this implicit smartmatch in various rather loosely-defined situations, as roughly outlined above. (The difference is largely because Perl 5 does not have, even internally, a boolean type.)</p>
