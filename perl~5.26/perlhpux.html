<h2 id="NAME">NAME</h2> <p>perlhpux - Perl version 5 on Hewlett-Packard Unix (HP-UX) systems</p> <h2 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h2> <p>This document describes various features of HP's Unix operating system (HP-UX) that will affect how Perl version 5 (hereafter just Perl) is compiled and/or runs.</p> <h3 id="Using-perl-as-shipped-with-HP-UX">Using perl as shipped with HP-UX</h3> <p>Application release September 2001, HP-UX 11.00 is the first to ship with Perl. By the time it was perl-5.6.1 in /opt/perl. The first occurrence is on CD 5012-7954 and can be installed using</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">swinstall -s /cdrom perl
</pre>
<p>assuming you have mounted that CD on /cdrom.</p> <p>That build was a portable hppa-1.1 multithread build that supports large files compiled with gcc-2.9-hppa-991112.</p> <p>If you perform a new installation, then (a newer) Perl will be installed automatically. Pre-installed HP-UX systems now have more recent versions of Perl and the updated modules.</p> <p>The official (threaded) builds from HP, as they are shipped on the Application DVD/CD's are available on <a href="http://www.software.hp.com/portal/swdepot/displayProductInfo.do?productNumber=PERL">http://www.software.hp.com/portal/swdepot/displayProductInfo.do?productNumber=PERL</a> for both PA-RISC and IPF (Itanium Processor Family). They are built with the HP ANSI-C compiler. Up till 5.8.8 that was done by ActiveState.</p> <p>To see what version is included on the DVD (assumed here to be mounted on /cdrom), issue this command:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl"># swlist -s /cdrom perl
# perl           D.5.8.8.B  5.8.8 Perl Programming Language

</pre>
<p>To see what is installed on your system:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl"># swlist -R perl

<h3 id="Using-perl-from-HP's-porting-centre">Using perl from HP's porting centre</h3> <p>HP porting centre tries to keep up with customer demand and release updates from the Open Source community. Having precompiled Perl binaries available is obvious, though "up-to-date" is something relative. At the moment of writing only perl-5.10.1 was available (with 5.16.3 being the latest stable release from the porters point of view).</p> <p>The HP porting centres are limited in what systems they are allowed to port to and they usually choose the two most recent OS versions available.</p> <p>HP has asked the porting centre to move Open Source binaries from /opt to /usr/local, so binaries produced since the start of July 2002 are located in /usr/local.</p> <p>One of HP porting centres URL's is <a href="http://hpux.connect.org.uk/">http://hpux.connect.org.uk/</a> The port currently available is built with GNU gcc.</p> <h3 id="Other-prebuilt-perl-binaries">Other prebuilt perl binaries</h3> <p>To get even more recent perl depots for the whole range of HP-UX, visit H.Merijn Brand's site at <a href="http://mirrors.develooper.com/hpux/#Perl">http://mirrors.develooper.com/hpux/#Perl</a>. Carefully read the notes to see if the available versions suit your needs.</p> <h3 id="Compiling-Perl-5-on-HP-UX">Compiling Perl 5 on HP-UX</h3> <p>When compiling Perl, you must use an ANSI C compiler. The C compiler that ships with all HP-UX systems is a K&amp;R compiler that should only be used to build new kernels.</p> <p>Perl can be compiled with either HP's ANSI C compiler or with gcc. The former is recommended, as not only can it compile Perl with no difficulty, but also can take advantage of features listed later that require the use of HP compiler-specific command-line flags.</p> <p>If you decide to use gcc, make sure your installation is recent and complete, and be sure to read the Perl INSTALL file for more gcc-specific details.</p> <h3 id="PA-RISC">PA-RISC</h3> <p>HP's HP9000 Unix systems run on HP's own Precision Architecture (PA-RISC) chip. HP-UX used to run on the Motorola MC68000 family of chips, but any machine with this chip in it is quite obsolete and this document will not attempt to address issues for compiling Perl on the Motorola chipset.</p> <p>The version of PA-RISC at the time of this document's last update is 2.0, which is also the last there will be. HP PA-RISC systems are usually referred to with model description "HP 9000". The last CPU in this series is the PA-8900. Support for PA-RISC architectured machines officially ends as shown in the following table:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">  PA-RISC End-of-Life Roadmap

<p>See for the full list of hardware/OS support and expected end-of-life <a href="http://www.hp.com/go/hpuxservermatrix">http://www.hp.com/go/hpuxservermatrix</a></p> <h3 id="Building-Dynamic-Extensions-on-HP-UX">Building Dynamic Extensions on HP-UX</h3> <p>HP-UX supports dynamically loadable libraries (shared libraries). Shared libraries end with the suffix .sl. On Itanium systems, they end with the suffix .so.</p> <p>Shared libraries created on a platform using a particular PA-RISC version are not usable on platforms using an earlier PA-RISC version by default. However, this backwards compatibility may be enabled using the same +DAportable compiler flag (with the same PA-RISC 1.0 caveat mentioned above).</p> <p>Shared libraries created on an Itanium platform cannot be loaded on a PA-RISC platform. Shared libraries created on a PA-RISC platform can only be loaded on an Itanium platform if it is a PA-RISC executable that is attempting to load the PA-RISC library. A PA-RISC shared library cannot be loaded into an Itanium executable nor vice-versa.</p> <p>To create a shared library, the following steps must be performed:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">1. Compile source modules with +z or +Z flag to create a .o module
   which contains Position-Independent Code (PIC).  The linker will
   tell you in the next step if +Z was needed.
   (For gcc, the appropriate flag is -fpic or -fPIC.)

2. Link the shared library using the -b flag.  If the code calls
   any functions in other system libraries (e.g., libm), it must
   be included on this line.
</pre>
<p>(Note that these steps are usually handled automatically by the extension's Makefile).</p> <p>If these dependent libraries are not listed at shared library creation time, you will get fatal "Unresolved symbol" errors at run time when the library is loaded.</p> <p>You may create a shared library that refers to another library, which may be either an archive library or a shared library. If this second library is a shared library, this is called a "dependent library". The dependent library's name is recorded in the main shared library, but it is not linked into the shared library. Instead, it is loaded when the main shared library is loaded. This can cause problems if you build an extension on one system and move it to another system where the libraries may not be located in the same place as on the first system.</p> <p>If the referred library is an archive library, then it is treated as a simple collection of .o modules (all of which must contain PIC). These modules are then linked into the shared library.</p> <p>Note that it is okay to create a library which contains a dependent library that is already linked into perl.</p> <p>Some extensions, like DB_File and Compress::Zlib use/require prebuilt libraries for the perl extensions/modules to work. If these libraries are built using the default configuration, it might happen that you run into an error like "invalid loader fixup" during load phase. HP is aware of this problem. Search the HP-UX cxx-dev forums for discussions about the subject. The short answer is that <b>everything</b> (all libraries, everything) must be compiled with <code class="inline">+<span class="w">z</span></code> or <code class="inline">+<span class="w">Z</span></code> to be PIC (position independent code). (For gcc, that would be <code class="inline">-<span class="w">fpic</span></code> or <code class="inline">-<span class="w">fPIC</span></code> ). In HP-UX 11.00 or newer the linker error message should tell the name of the offending object file.</p> <p>A more general approach is to intervene manually, as with an example for the DB_File module, which requires SleepyCat's libdb.sl:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl"># cd .../db-3.2.9/build_unix
# vi Makefile
... add +Z to all cflags to create shared objects
CFLAGS=         -c $(CPPFLAGS) +Z -Ae +O2 +Onolimit \
                -I/usr/local/include -I/usr/include/X11R6
CXXFLAGS=       -c $(CPPFLAGS) +Z -Ae +O2 +Onolimit \
                -I/usr/local/include -I/usr/include/X11R6

# make clean
# make
# mkdir tmp
# cd tmp
# ar x ../libdb.a
# ld -b -o libdb-3.2.sl *.o
# mv libdb-3.2.sl /usr/local/lib
# rm *.o
# cd /usr/local/lib
# rm -f libdb.sl
# ln -s libdb-3.2.sl libdb.sl

# cd .../DB_File-1.76
# make distclean
# perl Makefile.PL
# make
# make test
# make install
</pre>
<p>As of db-4.2.x it is no longer needed to do this by hand. Sleepycat has changed the configuration process to add +z on HP-UX automatically.</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl"># cd .../db-4.2.25/build_unix
# env CFLAGS=+DD64 LDFLAGS=+DD64 ../dist/configure
</pre>
<p>should work to generate 64bit shared libraries for HP-UX 11.00 and 11i.</p> <p>It is no longer possible to link PA-RISC 1.0 shared libraries (even though the command-line flags are still present).</p> <p>PA-RISC and Itanium object files are not interchangeable. Although you may be able to use ar to create an archive library of PA-RISC object files on an Itanium system, you cannot link against it using an Itanium link editor.</p> <h3 id="The-HP-ANSI-C-Compiler">The HP ANSI C Compiler</h3> <p>When using this compiler to build Perl, you should make sure that the flag -Aa is added to the cpprun and cppstdin variables in the config.sh file (though see the section on 64-bit perl below). If you are using a recent version of the Perl distribution, these flags are set automatically.</p> <p>Even though HP-UX 10.20 and 11.00 are not actively maintained by HP anymore, updates for the HP ANSI C compiler are still available from time to time, and it might be advisable to see if updates are applicable. At the moment of writing, the latests available patches for 11.00 that should be applied are PHSS_35098, PHSS_35175, PHSS_35100, PHSS_33036, and PHSS_33902). If you have a SUM account, you can use it to search for updates/patches. Enter "ANSI" as keyword.</p> <h3 id="The-GNU-C-Compiler">The GNU C Compiler</h3> <p>When you are going to use the GNU C compiler (gcc), and you don't have gcc yet, you can either build it yourself from the sources (available from e.g. <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/mirrors.html">http://gcc.gnu.org/mirrors.html</a>) or fetch a prebuilt binary from the HP porting center at <a href="http://hpux.connect.org.uk/hppd/cgi-bin/search?term=gcc&amp;Search=Search">http://hpux.connect.org.uk/hppd/cgi-bin/search?term=gcc&amp;Search=Search</a> or from the DSPP (you need to be a member) at <a href="http://h21007.www2.hp.com/portal/site/dspp/menuitem.863c3e4cbcdc3f3515b49c108973a801?ciid=2a08725cc2f02110725cc2f02110275d6e10RCRD&amp;jumpid=reg_r1002_usen_c-001_title_r0001">http://h21007.www2.hp.com/portal/site/dspp/menuitem.863c3e4cbcdc3f3515b49c108973a801?ciid=2a08725cc2f02110725cc2f02110275d6e10RCRD&amp;jumpid=reg_r1002_usen_c-001_title_r0001</a> (Browse through the list, because there are often multiple versions of the same package available).</p> <p>Most mentioned distributions are depots. H.Merijn Brand has made prebuilt gcc binaries available on <a href="http://mirrors.develooper.com/hpux/">http://mirrors.develooper.com/hpux/</a> and/or <a href="http://www.cmve.net/~merijn/">http://www.cmve.net/~merijn/</a> for HP-UX 10.20 (only 32bit), HP-UX 11.00, HP-UX 11.11 (HP-UX 11i v1), and HP-UX 11.23 (HP-UX 11i v2 PA-RISC) in both 32- and 64-bit versions. For HP-UX 11.23 IPF and HP-UX 11.31 IPF depots are available too. The IPF versions do not need two versions of GNU gcc.</p> <p>On PA-RISC you need a different compiler for 32-bit applications and for 64-bit applications. On PA-RISC, 32-bit objects and 64-bit objects do not mix. Period. There is no different behaviour for HP C-ANSI-C or GNU gcc. So if you require your perl binary to use 64-bit libraries, like Oracle-64bit, you MUST build a 64-bit perl.</p> <p>Building a 64-bit capable gcc on PA-RISC from source is possible only when you have the HP C-ANSI C compiler or an already working 64-bit binary of gcc available. Best performance for perl is achieved with HP's native compiler.</p> <h3 id="Using-Large-Files-with-Perl-on-HP-UX">Using Large Files with Perl on HP-UX</h3> <p>Beginning with HP-UX version 10.20, files larger than 2GB (2^31 bytes) may be created and manipulated. Three separate methods of doing this are available. Of these methods, the best method for Perl is to compile using the -Duselargefiles flag to Configure. This causes Perl to be compiled using structures and functions in which these are 64 bits wide, rather than 32 bits wide. (Note that this will only work with HP's ANSI C compiler. If you want to compile Perl using gcc, you will have to get a version of the compiler that supports 64-bit operations. See above for where to find it.)</p> <p>There are some drawbacks to this approach. One is that any extension which calls any file-manipulating C function will need to be recompiled (just follow the usual "perl Makefile.PL; make; make test; make install" procedure).</p> <p>The list of functions that will need to recompiled is: creat, fgetpos, fopen, freopen, fsetpos, fstat, fstatvfs, fstatvfsdev, ftruncate, ftw, lockf, lseek, lstat, mmap, nftw, open, prealloc, stat, statvfs, statvfsdev, tmpfile, truncate, getrlimit, setrlimit</p> <p>Another drawback is only valid for Perl versions before 5.6.0. This drawback is that the seek and tell functions (both the builtin version and POSIX module version) will not perform correctly.</p> <p>It is strongly recommended that you use this flag when you run Configure. If you do not do this, but later answer the question about large files when Configure asks you, you may get a configuration that cannot be compiled, or that does not function as expected.</p> <h3 id="Threaded-Perl-on-HP-UX">Threaded Perl on HP-UX</h3> <p>It is possible to compile a version of threaded Perl on any version of HP-UX before 10.30, but it is strongly suggested that you be running on HP-UX 11.00 at least.</p> <p>To compile Perl with threads, add -Dusethreads to the arguments of Configure. Verify that the -D_POSIX_C_SOURCE=199506L compiler flag is automatically added to the list of flags. Also make sure that -lpthread is listed before -lc in the list of libraries to link Perl with. The hints provided for HP-UX during Configure will try very hard to get this right for you.</p> <p>HP-UX versions before 10.30 require a separate installation of a POSIX threads library package. Two examples are the HP DCE package, available on "HP-UX Hardware Extensions 3.0, Install and Core OS, Release 10.20, April 1999 (B3920-13941)" or the Freely available PTH package, available on H.Merijn's site (<a href="http://mirrors.develooper.com/hpux/">http://mirrors.develooper.com/hpux/</a>). The use of PTH will be unsupported in perl-5.12 and up and is rather buggy in 5.11.x.</p> <p>If you are going to use the HP DCE package, the library used for threading is /usr/lib/libcma.sl, but there have been multiple updates of that library over time. Perl will build with the first version, but it will not pass the test suite. Older Oracle versions might be a compelling reason not to update that library, otherwise please find a newer version in one of the following patches: PHSS_19739, PHSS_20608, or PHSS_23672</p> <p>reformatted output:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">d3:/usr/lib 106 &gt; what libcma-*.1

<p>For building perl to support Oracle, it needs to be linked with libcl and libpthread. So even if your perl is an unthreaded build, these libraries might be required. See "Oracle on HP-UX" below.</p> <h3 id="64-bit-Perl-on-HP-UX">64-bit Perl on HP-UX</h3> <p>Beginning with HP-UX 11.00, programs compiled under HP-UX can take advantage of the LP64 programming environment (LP64 means Longs and Pointers are 64 bits wide), in which scalar variables will be able to hold numbers larger than 2^32 with complete precision. Perl has proven to be consistent and reliable in 64bit mode since 5.8.1 on all HP-UX 11.xx.</p> <p>As of the date of this document, Perl is fully 64-bit compliant on HP-UX 11.00 and up for both cc- and gcc builds. If you are about to build a 64-bit perl with GNU gcc, please read the gcc section carefully.</p> <p>Should a user have the need for compiling Perl in the LP64 environment, use the -Duse64bitall flag to Configure. This will force Perl to be compiled in a pure LP64 environment (with the +DD64 flag for HP C-ANSI-C, with no additional options for GNU gcc 64-bit on PA-RISC, and with -mlp64 for GNU gcc on Itanium). If you want to compile Perl using gcc, you will have to get a version of the compiler that supports 64-bit operations.)</p> <p>You can also use the -Duse64bitint flag to Configure. Although there are some minor differences between compiling Perl with this flag versus the -Duse64bitall flag, they should not be noticeable from a Perl user's perspective. When configuring -Duse64bitint using a 64bit gcc on a pa-risc architecture, -Duse64bitint is silently promoted to -Duse64bitall.</p> <p>In both cases, it is strongly recommended that you use these flags when you run Configure. If you do not use do this, but later answer the questions about 64-bit numbers when Configure asks you, you may get a configuration that cannot be compiled, or that does not function as expected.</p> <h3 id="Oracle-on-HP-UX">Oracle on HP-UX</h3> <p>Using perl to connect to Oracle databases through DBI and DBD::Oracle has caused a lot of people many headaches. Read README.hpux in the DBD::Oracle for much more information. The reason to mention it here is that Oracle requires a perl built with libcl and libpthread, the latter even when perl is build without threads. Building perl using all defaults, but still enabling to build DBD::Oracle later on can be achieved using</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">Configure -A prepend:libswanted='cl pthread ' ...
</pre>
<p>Do not forget the space before the trailing quote.</p> <p>Also note that this does not (yet) work with all configurations, it is known to fail with 64-bit versions of GCC.</p> <h3 id="GDBM-and-Threads-on-HP-UX">GDBM and Threads on HP-UX</h3> <p>If you attempt to compile Perl with (POSIX) threads on an 11.X system and also link in the GDBM library, then Perl will immediately core dump when it starts up. The only workaround at this point is to relink the GDBM library under 11.X, then relink it into Perl.</p> <p>the error might show something like:</p> <p>Pthread internal error: message: __libc_reinit() failed, file: ../pthreads/pthread.c, line: 1096 Return Pointer is 0xc082bf33 sh: 5345 Quit(coredump)</p> <p>and Configure will give up.</p> <h3 id="NFS-filesystems-and-utime(2)-on-HP-UX">NFS filesystems and utime(2) on HP-UX</h3> <p>If you are compiling Perl on a remotely-mounted NFS filesystem, the test io/fs.t may fail on test #18. This appears to be a bug in HP-UX and no fix is currently available.</p> <h3 id="HP-UX-Kernel-Parameters-(maxdsiz)-for-Compiling-Perl">HP-UX Kernel Parameters (maxdsiz) for Compiling Perl</h3> <p>By default, HP-UX comes configured with a maximum data segment size of 64MB. This is too small to correctly compile Perl with the maximum optimization levels. You can increase the size of the maxdsiz kernel parameter through the use of SAM.</p> <p>When using the GUI version of SAM, click on the Kernel Configuration icon, then the Configurable Parameters icon. Scroll down and select the maxdsiz line. From the Actions menu, select the Modify Configurable Parameter item. Insert the new formula into the Formula/Value box. Then follow the instructions to rebuild your kernel and reboot your system.</p> <p>In general, a value of 256MB (or "256*1024*1024") is sufficient for Perl to compile at maximum optimization.</p> <h2 id="nss_delete-core-dump-from-op%2fpwent-or-op%2fgrent">nss_delete core dump from op/pwent or op/grent</h2> <p>You may get a bus error core dump from the op/pwent or op/grent tests. If compiled with -g you will see a stack trace much like the following:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">#0  0xc004216c in  () from /usr/lib/libc.2
