<h2 id="NAME">NAME</h2> <p>perlglossary - Perl Glossary</p> <h2 id="VERSION">VERSION</h2> <p>version 5.021009</p> <h2 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h2> <p>A glossary of terms (technical and otherwise) used in the Perl documentation, derived from the Glossary of <i>Programming Perl</i>, Fourth Edition. Words or phrases in bold are defined elsewhere in this glossary.</p> <p>Other useful sources include the Unicode Glossary <a href="http://unicode.org/glossary/">http://unicode.org/glossary/</a>, the Free On-Line Dictionary of Computing <a href="http://foldoc.org/">http://foldoc.org/</a>, the Jargon File <a href="http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/">http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/</a>, and Wikipedia <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">http://www.wikipedia.org/</a>.</p> <h3 id="A">A</h3> <ul> <li id="accessor-methods">
<b>accessor methods</b> <p>A <b>method</b> used to indirectly inspect or update an <b>object</b>’s state (its <b>instance variables</b>).</p> </li> <li id="actual-arguments">
<b>actual arguments</b> <p>The <b>scalar values</b> that you supply to a <b>function</b> or <b>subroutine</b> when you call it. For instance, when you call <code class="inline"><span class="i">power</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="q">"puff"</span><span class="s">)</span></code> , the string <code class="inline"><span class="q">"puff"</span></code> is the actual argument. See also <b>argument</b> and <b>formal arguments</b>.</p> </li> <li id="address-operator">
<b>address operator</b> <p>Some languages work directly with the memory addresses of values, but this can be like playing with fire. Perl provides a set of asbestos gloves for handling all memory management. The closest to an address operator in Perl is the backslash operator, but it gives you a <b>hard reference</b>, which is much safer than a memory address.</p> </li> <li id="algorithm">
<b>algorithm</b> <p>A well-defined sequence of steps, explained clearly enough that even a computer could do them.</p> </li> <li id="alias">
<b>alias</b> <p>A nickname for something, which behaves in all ways as though you’d used the original name instead of the nickname. Temporary aliases are implicitly created in the loop variable for <code class="inline">foreach</code> loops, in the <code class="inline"><span class="i">$_</span></code> variable for <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/map">map</a></code> or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/grep">grep</a></code> operators, in <code class="inline"><span class="i">$a</span></code> and <code class="inline"><span class="i">$b</span></code> during <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/sort">sort</a></code>’s comparison function, and in each element of <code class="inline"><span class="i">@_</span></code> for the <b>actual arguments</b> of a subroutine call. Permanent aliases are explicitly created in <b>packages</b> by <b>importing</b> symbols or by assignment to <b>typeglobs</b>. Lexically scoped aliases for package variables are explicitly created by the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/our">our</a></code> declaration.</p> </li> <li id="alphabetic">
<b>alphabetic</b> <p>The sort of characters we put into words. In Unicode, this is all letters including all ideographs and certain diacritics, letter numbers like Roman numerals, and various combining marks.</p> </li> <li id="alternatives">
<b>alternatives</b> <p>A list of possible choices from which you may select only one, as in, “Would you like door A, B, or C?” Alternatives in regular expressions are separated with a single vertical bar: <code class="inline">|</code>. Alternatives in normal Perl expressions are separated with a double vertical bar: <code class="inline">||</code>. Logical alternatives in <b>Boolean</b> expressions are separated with either <code class="inline">||</code> or <code class="inline">or</code> .</p> </li> <li id="anonymous">
<b>anonymous</b> <p>Used to describe a <b>referent</b> that is not directly accessible through a named <b>variable</b>. Such a referent must be indirectly accessible through at least one <b>hard reference</b>. When the last hard reference goes away, the anonymous referent is destroyed without pity.</p> </li> <li id="application">
<b>application</b> <p>A bigger, fancier sort of <b>program</b> with a fancier name so people don’t realize they are using a program.</p> </li> <li id="architecture">
<b>architecture</b> <p>The kind of computer you’re working on, where one “kind of computer” means all those computers sharing a compatible machine language. Since Perl programs are (typically) simple text files, not executable images, a Perl program is much less sensitive to the architecture it’s running on than programs in other languages, such as C, that are <b>compiled</b> into machine code. See also <b>platform</b> and <b>operating system</b>.</p> </li> <li id="argument">
<b>argument</b> <p>A piece of data supplied to a <b>program</b>, <b>subroutine</b>, <b>function</b>, or <b>method</b> to tell it what it’s supposed to do. Also called a “parameter”.</p> </li> <li id="ARGV">
<b>ARGV</b> <p>The name of the array containing the <b>argument</b> <b>vector</b> from the command line. If you use the empty <code class="inline">&lt;&gt;</code> operator, <code class="inline"><span class="w">ARGV</span></code> is the name of both the <b>filehandle</b> used to traverse the arguments and the <b>scalar</b> containing the name of the current input file.</p> </li> <li id="arithmetical-operator">
<b>arithmetical operator</b> <p>A <b>symbol</b> such as <code class="inline">+</code> or <code class="inline">/</code> that tells Perl to do the arithmetic you were supposed to learn in grade school.</p> </li> <li id="array">
<b>array</b> <p>An ordered sequence of <b>values</b>, stored such that you can easily access any of the values using an <i>integer subscript</i> that specifies the value’s <b>offset</b> in the sequence.</p> </li> <li id="array-context">
<b>array context</b> <p>An archaic expression for what is more correctly referred to as <b>list context</b>.</p> </li> <li id="Artistic-License">
<b>Artistic License</b> <p>The open source license that Larry Wall created for Perl, maximizing Perl’s usefulness, availability, and modifiability. The current version is 2. (<a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/artistic-license.php">http://www.opensource.org/licenses/artistic-license.php</a>).</p> </li> <li id="ASCII">
<b>ASCII</b> <p>The American Standard Code for Information Interchange (a 7-bit character set adequate only for poorly representing English text). Often used loosely to describe the lowest 128 values of the various ISO-8859-X character sets, a bunch of mutually incompatible 8-bit codes best described as half ASCII. See also <b>Unicode</b>.</p> </li> <li id="assertion">
<b>assertion</b> <p>A component of a <b>regular expression</b> that must be true for the pattern to match but does not necessarily match any characters itself. Often used specifically to mean a <b>zero-width</b> assertion.</p> </li> <li id="assignment">
<b>assignment</b> <p>An <b>operator</b> whose assigned mission in life is to change the value of a <b>variable</b>.</p> </li> <li id="assignment-operator">
<b>assignment operator</b> <p>Either a regular <b>assignment</b> or a compound <b>operator</b> composed of an ordinary assignment and some other operator, that changes the value of a variable in place; that is, relative to its old value. For example, <code class="inline"><span class="i">$a</span> += <span class="n">2</span></code> adds <code class="inline"><span class="n">2</span></code> to <code class="inline"><span class="i">$a</span></code> .</p> </li> <li id="associative-array">
<b>associative array</b> <p>See <b>hash</b>. Please. The term associative array is the old Perl 4 term for a <b>hash</b>. Some languages call it a dictionary.</p> </li> <li id="associativity">
<b>associativity</b> <p>Determines whether you do the left <b>operator</b> first or the right <b>operator</b> first when you have “A <b>operator</b> B <b>operator</b> C”, and the two operators are of the same precedence. Operators like <code class="inline">+</code> are left associative, while operators like <code class="inline"><span class="i">**</span></code> are right associative. See Camel chapter 3, “Unary and Binary Operators” for a list of operators and their associativity.</p> </li> <li id="asynchronous">
<b>asynchronous</b> <p>Said of events or activities whose relative temporal ordering is indeterminate because too many things are going on at once. Hence, an asynchronous event is one you didn’t know when to expect.</p> </li> <li id="atom">
<b>atom</b> <p>A <b>regular expression</b> component potentially matching a <b>substring</b> containing one or more characters and treated as an indivisible syntactic unit by any following <b>quantifier</b>. (Contrast with an <b>assertion</b> that matches something of <b>zero width</b> and may not be quantified.)</p> </li> <li id="atomic-operation">
<b>atomic operation</b> <p>When Democritus gave the word “atom” to the indivisible bits of matter, he meant literally something that could not be cut: <i>ἀ-</i> (not) + <i>-τομος</i> (cuttable). An atomic operation is an action that can’t be interrupted, not one forbidden in a nuclear-free zone.</p> </li> <li id="attribute">
<b>attribute</b> <p>A new feature that allows the declaration of <b>variables</b> and <b>subroutines</b> with modifiers, as in <code class="inline">sub <span class="m">foo</span> <span class="co">:</span> <span class="w">locked</span>
<span class="w">method</span></code> . Also another name for an <b>instance variable</b> of an <b>object</b>.</p> </li> <li id="autogeneration">
<b>autogeneration</b> <p>A feature of <b>operator overloading</b> of <b>objects</b>, whereby the behavior of certain <b>operators</b> can be reasonably deduced using more fundamental operators. This assumes that the overloaded operators will often have the same relationships as the regular operators. See Camel chapter 13, “Overloading”.</p> </li> <li id="autoincrement">
<b>autoincrement</b> <p>To add one to something automatically, hence the name of the <code class="inline">++</code> operator. To instead subtract one from something automatically is known as an “autodecrement”.</p> </li> <li id="autoload">
<b>autoload</b> <p>To load on demand. (Also called “lazy” loading.) Specifically, to call an <code class="inline">AUTOLOAD</code> subroutine on behalf of an undefined subroutine.</p> </li> <li id="autosplit">
<b>autosplit</b> <p>To split a string automatically, as the <i>–a</i> <b>switch</b> does when running under <i>–p</i> or <i>–n</i> in order to emulate <b>awk</b>. (See also the <code class="inline"><span class="w">AutoSplit</span></code> module, which has nothing to do with the <code class="inline"><span class="q">–a</span></code> switch but a lot to do with autoloading.)</p> </li> <li id="autovivification">
<b>autovivification</b> <p>A Graeco-Roman word meaning “to bring oneself to life”. In Perl, storage locations (<b>lvalues</b>) spontaneously generate themselves as needed, including the creation of any <b>hard reference</b> values to point to the next level of storage. The assignment <code class="inline"><span class="i">$a</span>[<span class="n">5</span>][<span class="n">5</span>][<span class="n">5</span>][<span class="n">5</span>][<span class="n">5</span>] = <span class="q">"quintet"</span></code> potentially creates five scalar storage locations, plus four references (in the first four scalar locations) pointing to four new anonymous arrays (to hold the last four scalar locations). But the point of autovivification is that you don’t have to worry about it.</p> </li> <li id="AV">
<b>AV</b> <p>Short for “array value”, which refers to one of Perl’s internal data types that holds an <b>array</b>. The <code class="inline"><span class="w">AV</span></code> type is a subclass of <b>SV</b>.</p> </li> <li id="awk">
<b>awk</b> <p>Descriptive editing term—short for “awkward”. Also coincidentally refers to a venerable text-processing language from which Perl derived some of its high-level ideas.</p> </li> </ul> <h3 id="B">B</h3> <ul> <li id="backreference">
<b>backreference</b> <p>A substring <b>captured</b> by a subpattern within unadorned parentheses in a <b>regex</b>. Backslashed decimal numbers (<code class="inline">\<span class="n">1</span></code> , <code class="inline">\<span class="n">2</span></code> , etc.) later in the same pattern refer back to the corresponding subpattern in the current match. Outside the pattern, the numbered variables (<code class="inline"><span class="i">$1</span></code> , <code class="inline"><span class="i">$2</span></code> , etc.) continue to refer to these same values, as long as the pattern was the last successful match of the current <b>dynamic scope</b>.</p> </li> <li id="backtracking">
<b>backtracking</b> <p>The practice of saying, “If I had to do it all over, I’d do it differently,” and then actually going back and doing it all over differently. Mathematically speaking, it’s returning from an unsuccessful recursion on a tree of possibilities. Perl backtracks when it attempts to match patterns with a <b>regular expression</b>, and its earlier attempts don’t pan out. See the section “The Little Engine That /Couldn(n’t)” in Camel chapter 5, “Pattern Matching”.</p> </li> <li id="backward-compatibility">
<b>backward compatibility</b> <p>Means you can still run your old program because we didn’t break any of the features or bugs it was relying on.</p> </li> <li id="bareword">
<b>bareword</b> <p>A word sufficiently ambiguous to be deemed illegal under <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use">use</a> <span class="w">strict</span> <span class="q">'subs'</span></code> . In the absence of that stricture, a bareword is treated as if quotes were around it.</p> </li> <li id="base-class">
<b>base class</b> <p>A generic <b>object</b> type; that is, a <b>class</b> from which other, more specific classes are derived genetically by <b>inheritance</b>. Also called a “superclass” by people who respect their ancestors.</p> </li> <li id="big-endian">
<b>big-endian</b> <p>From Swift: someone who eats eggs big end first. Also used of computers that store the most significant <b>byte</b> of a word at a lower byte address than the least significant byte. Often considered superior to little-endian machines. See also <b>little-endian</b>.</p> </li> <li id="binary">
<b>binary</b> <p>Having to do with numbers represented in base 2. That means there’s basically two numbers: 0 and 1. Also used to describe a file of “nontext”, presumably because such a file makes full use of all the binary bits in its bytes. With the advent of <b>Unicode</b>, this distinction, already suspect, loses even more of its meaning.</p> </li> <li id="binary-operator">
<b>binary operator</b> <p>An <b>operator</b> that takes two <b>operands</b>.</p> </li> <li id="bind">
<b>bind</b> <p>To assign a specific <b>network address</b> to a <b>socket</b>.</p> </li> <li id="bit">
<b>bit</b> <p>An integer in the range from 0 to 1, inclusive. The smallest possible unit of information storage. An eighth of a <b>byte</b> or of a dollar. (The term “Pieces of Eight” comes from being able to split the old Spanish dollar into 8 bits, each of which still counted for money. That’s why a 25- cent piece today is still “two bits”.)</p> </li> <li id="bit-shift">
<b>bit shift</b> <p>The movement of bits left or right in a computer word, which has the effect of multiplying or dividing by a power of 2.</p> </li> <li id="bit-string">
<b>bit string</b> <p>A sequence of <b>bits</b> that is actually being thought of as a sequence of bits, for once.</p> </li> <li id="bless">
<b>bless</b> <p>In corporate life, to grant official approval to a thing, as in, “The VP of Engineering has blessed our WebCruncher project.” Similarly, in Perl, to grant official approval to a <b>referent</b> so that it can function as an <b>object</b>, such as a WebCruncher object. See the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/bless">bless</a></code> function in Camel chapter 27, “Functions”.</p> </li> <li id="block">
<b>block</b> <p>What a <b>process</b> does when it has to wait for something: “My process blocked waiting for the disk.” As an unrelated noun, it refers to a large chunk of data, of a size that the <b>operating system</b> likes to deal with (normally a power of 2 such as 512 or 8192). Typically refers to a chunk of data that’s coming from or going to a disk file.</p> </li> <li id="BLOCK">
<b>BLOCK</b> <p>A syntactic construct consisting of a sequence of Perl <b>statements</b> that is delimited by braces. The <code class="inline">if</code> and <code class="inline">while</code> statements are defined in terms of <i><code class="inline"><span class="w">BLOCK</span></code> </i>s, for instance. Sometimes we also say “block” to mean a lexical scope; that is, a sequence of statements that acts like a <i><code class="inline"><span class="w">BLOCK</span></code> </i>, such as within an <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/eval">eval</a></code> or a file, even though the statements aren’t delimited by braces.</p> </li> <li id="block-buffering">
<b>block buffering</b> <p>A method of making input and output efficient by passing one <b>block</b> at a time. By default, Perl does block buffering to disk files. See <b>buffer</b> and <b>command buffering</b>.</p> </li> <li id="Boolean">
<b>Boolean</b> <p>A value that is either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>.</p> </li> <li id="Boolean-context">
<b>Boolean context</b> <p>A special kind of <b>scalar context</b> used in conditionals to decide whether the <b>scalar value</b> returned by an expression is <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>. Does not evaluate as either a string or a number. See <b>context</b>.</p> </li> <li id="breakpoint">
<b>breakpoint</b> <p>A spot in your program where you’ve told the debugger to stop <b>execution</b> so you can poke around and see whether anything is wrong yet.</p> </li> <li id="broadcast">
<b>broadcast</b> <p>To send a <b>datagram</b> to multiple destinations simultaneously.</p> </li> <li id="BSD">
<b>BSD</b> <p>A psychoactive drug, popular in the ’80s, probably developed at UC Berkeley or thereabouts. Similar in many ways to the prescription-only medication called “System V”, but infinitely more useful. (Or, at least, more fun.) The full chemical name is “Berkeley Standard Distribution”.</p> </li> <li id="bucket">
<b>bucket</b> <p>A location in a <b>hash table</b> containing (potentially) multiple entries whose keys “hash” to the same hash value according to its hash function. (As internal policy, you don’t have to worry about it unless you’re into internals, or policy.)</p> </li> <li id="buffer">
<b>buffer</b> <p>A temporary holding location for data. Data that are <b>Block buffering</b> means that the data is passed on to its destination whenever the buffer is full. <b>Line buffering</b> means that it’s passed on whenever a complete line is received. <b>Command buffering</b> means that it’s passed every time you do a <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/print">print</a></code> command (or equivalent). If your output is unbuffered, the system processes it one byte at a time without the use of a holding area. This can be rather inefficient.</p> </li> <li id="built-in">
<b>built-in</b> <p>A <b>function</b> that is predefined in the language. Even when hidden by <b>overriding</b>, you can always get at a built- in function by <b>qualifying</b> its name with the <code class="inline"><span class="w">CORE::</span></code> pseudopackage.</p> </li> <li id="bundle">
<b>bundle</b> <p>A group of related modules on <b>CPAN</b>. (Also sometimes refers to a group of command-line switches grouped into one <b>switch cluster</b>.)</p> </li> <li id="byte">
<b>byte</b> <p>A piece of data worth eight <b>bits</b> in most places.</p> </li> <li id="bytecode">
<b>bytecode</b> <p>A pidgin-like lingo spoken among ’droids when they don’t wish to reveal their orientation (see <b>endian</b>). Named after some similar languages spoken (for similar reasons) between compilers and interpreters in the late 20ᵗʰ century. These languages are characterized by representing everything as a nonarchitecture-dependent sequence of bytes.</p> </li> </ul> <h3 id="C">C</h3> <ul> <li id="C">
<b>C</b> <p>A language beloved by many for its inside-out <b>type</b> definitions, inscrutable <b>precedence</b> rules, and heavy <b>overloading</b> of the function-call mechanism. (Well, actually, people first switched to C because they found lowercase identifiers easier to read than upper.) Perl is written in C, so it’s not surprising that Perl borrowed a few ideas from it.</p> </li> <li id="cache">
<b>cache</b> <p>A data repository. Instead of computing expensive answers several times, compute it once and save the result.</p> </li> <li id="callback">
<b>callback</b> <p>A <b>handler</b> that you register with some other part of your program in the hope that the other part of your program will <b>trigger</b> your handler when some event of interest transpires.</p> </li> <li id="call-by-reference">
<b>call by reference</b> <p>An <b>argument</b>-passing mechanism in which the <b>formal arguments</b> refer directly to the <b>actual arguments</b>, and the <b>subroutine</b> can change the actual arguments by changing the formal arguments. That is, the formal argument is an <b>alias</b> for the actual argument. See also <b>call by value</b>.</p> </li> <li id="call-by-value">
<b>call by value</b> <p>An <b>argument</b>-passing mechanism in which the <b>formal arguments</b> refer to a copy of the <b>actual arguments</b>, and the <b>subroutine</b> cannot change the actual arguments by changing the formal arguments. See also <b>call by reference</b>.</p> </li> <li id="canonical">
<b>canonical</b> <p>Reduced to a standard form to facilitate comparison.</p> </li> <li id="capture-variables">
<b>capture variables</b> <p>The variables—such as <code class="inline"><span class="i">$1</span></code> and <code class="inline"><span class="i">$2</span></code> , and <code class="inline"><span class="i">%+</span></code> and <code class="inline"><span class="i">%–</span> </code> —that hold the text remembered in a pattern match. See Camel chapter 5, “Pattern Matching”.</p> </li> <li id="capturing">
<b>capturing</b> <p>The use of parentheses around a <b>subpattern</b> in a <b>regular expression</b> to store the matched <b>substring</b> as a <b>backreference</b>. (Captured strings are also returned as a list in <b>list context</b>.) See Camel chapter 5, “Pattern Matching”.</p> </li> <li id="cargo-cult">
<b>cargo cult</b> <p>Copying and pasting code without understanding it, while superstitiously believing in its value. This term originated from preindustrial cultures dealing with the detritus of explorers and colonizers of technologically advanced cultures. See <i>The Gods Must Be Crazy</i>.</p> </li> <li id="case">
<b>case</b> <p>A property of certain characters. Originally, typesetter stored capital letters in the upper of two cases and small letters in the lower one. Unicode recognizes three cases: <b>lowercase</b> (<b>character property</b> <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">lower</span><span class="s">}</span></code> ), <b>titlecase</b> (<code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">title</span><span class="s">}</span></code> ), and <b>uppercase</b> (<code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">upper</span><span class="s">}</span></code> ). A fourth casemapping called <b>foldcase</b> is not itself a distinct case, but it is used internally to implement <b>casefolding</b>. Not all letters have case, and some nonletters have case.</p> </li> <li id="casefolding">
<b>casefolding</b> <p>Comparing or matching a string case-insensitively. In Perl, it is implemented with the <code class="inline">/i</code> pattern modifier, the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/fc">fc</a></code> function, and the <code class="inline">\<span class="w">F</span></code> double-quote translation escape.</p> </li> <li id="casemapping">
<b>casemapping</b> <p>The process of converting a string to one of the four Unicode <b>casemaps</b>; in Perl, it is implemented with the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/fc">fc</a></code>, <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/lc">lc</a></code>, <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/ucfirst">ucfirst</a></code>, and <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/uc">uc</a></code> functions.</p> </li> <li id="character">
<b>character</b> <p>The smallest individual element of a string. Computers store characters as integers, but Perl lets you operate on them as text. The integer used to represent a particular character is called that character’s <b>codepoint</b>.</p> </li> <li id="character-class">
<b>character class</b> <p>A square-bracketed list of characters used in a <b>regular expression</b> to indicate that any character of the set may occur at a given point. Loosely, any predefined set of characters so used.</p> </li> <li id="character-property">
<b>character property</b> <p>A predefined <b>character class</b> matchable by the <code class="inline">\<span class="w">p</span></code> or <code class="inline">\<span class="w">P</span></code> <b>metasymbol</b>. <b>Unicode</b> defines hundreds of standard properties for every possible codepoint, and Perl defines a few of its own, too.</p> </li> <li id="circumfix-operator">
<b>circumfix operator</b> <p>An <b>operator</b> that surrounds its <b>operand</b>, like the angle operator, or parentheses, or a hug.</p> </li> <li id="class">
<b>class</b> <p>A user-defined <b>type</b>, implemented in Perl via a <b>package</b> that provides (either directly or by inheritance) <b>methods</b> (that is, <b>subroutines</b>) to handle <b>instances</b> of the class (its <b>objects</b>). See also <b>inheritance</b>.</p> </li> <li id="class-method">
<b>class method</b> <p>A <b>method</b> whose <b>invocant</b> is a <b>package</b> name, not an <b>object</b> reference. A method associated with the class as a whole. Also see <b>instance method</b>.</p> </li> <li id="client">
<b>client</b> <p>In networking, a <b>process</b> that initiates contact with a <b>server</b> process in order to exchange data and perhaps receive a service.</p> </li> <li id="closure">
<b>closure</b> <p>An <b>anonymous</b> subroutine that, when a reference to it is generated at runtime, keeps track of the identities of externally visible <b>lexical variables</b>, even after those lexical variables have supposedly gone out of <b>scope</b>. They’re called “closures” because this sort of behavior gives mathematicians a sense of closure.</p> </li> <li id="cluster">
<b>cluster</b> <p>A parenthesized <b>subpattern</b> used to group parts of a <b>regular expression</b> into a single <b>atom</b>.</p> </li> <li id="CODE">
<b>CODE</b> <p>The word returned by the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/ref">ref</a></code> function when you apply it to a reference to a subroutine. See also <b>CV</b>.</p> </li> <li id="code-generator">
<b>code generator</b> <p>A system that writes code for you in a low-level language, such as code to implement the backend of a compiler. See <b>program generator</b>.</p> </li> <li id="codepoint">
<b>codepoint</b> <p>The integer a computer uses to represent a given character. ASCII codepoints are in the range 0 to 127; Unicode codepoints are in the range 0 to 0x1F_FFFF; and Perl codepoints are in the range 0 to 2³²−1 or 0 to 2⁶⁴−1, depending on your native integer size. In Perl Culture, sometimes called <b>ordinals</b>.</p> </li> <li id="code-subpattern">
<b>code subpattern</b> <p>A <b>regular expression</b> subpattern whose real purpose is to execute some Perl code—for example, the <code class="inline">(?{...})</code> and <code class="inline"><span class="s">(</span><span class="q">??</span><span class="s">{</span>...<span class="s">}</span><span class="s">)</span></code> subpatterns.</p> </li> <li id="collating-sequence">
<b>collating sequence</b> <p>The order into which <b>characters</b> sort. This is used by <b>string</b> comparison routines to decide, for example, where in this glossary to put “collating sequence”.</p> </li> <li id="co-maintainer">
<b>co-maintainer</b> <p>A person with permissions to index a <b>namespace</b> in <b>PAUSE</b>. Anyone can upload any namespace, but only primary and co-maintainers get their contributions indexed.</p> </li> <li id="combining-character">
<b>combining character</b> <p>Any character with the General Category of Combining Mark (<code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">GC</span>=<span class="w">M</span><span class="s">}</span></code> ), which may be spacing or nonspacing. Some are even invisible. A sequence of combining characters following a grapheme base character together make up a single user-visible character called a <b>grapheme</b>. Most but not all diacritics are combining characters, and vice versa.</p> </li> <li id="command">
<b>command</b> <p>In <b>shell</b> programming, the syntactic combination of a program name and its arguments. More loosely, anything you type to a shell (a command interpreter) that starts it doing something. Even more loosely, a Perl <b>statement</b>, which might start with a <b>label</b> and typically ends with a semicolon.</p> </li> <li id="command-buffering">
<b>command buffering</b> <p>A mechanism in Perl that lets you store up the output of each Perl <b>command</b> and then flush it out as a single request to the <b>operating system</b>. It’s enabled by setting the <code class="inline"><span class="i">$|</span></code> (<code class="inline"><span class="i">$AUTOFLUSH</span></code> ) variable to a true value. It’s used when you don’t want data sitting around, not going where it’s supposed to, which may happen because the default on a <b>file</b> or <b>pipe</b> is to use <b>block buffering</b>.</p> </li> <li id="command-line-arguments">
<b>command-line arguments</b> <p>The <b>values</b> you supply along with a program name when you tell a <b>shell</b> to execute a <b>command</b>. These values are passed to a Perl program through <code class="inline"><span class="i">@ARGV</span></code> .</p> </li> <li id="command-name">
<b>command name</b> <p>The name of the program currently executing, as typed on the command line. In C, the <b>command</b> name is passed to the program as the first command-line argument. In Perl, it comes in separately as <code class="inline"><span class="i">$0</span></code> .</p> </li> <li id="comment">
<b>comment</b> <p>A remark that doesn’t affect the meaning of the program. In Perl, a comment is introduced by a <code class="inline"><span class="c">#</span></code> character and continues to the end of the line.</p> </li> <li id="compilation-unit">
<b>compilation unit</b> <p>The <b>file</b> (or <b>string</b>, in the case of <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/eval">eval</a></code>) that is currently being <b>compiled</b>.</p> </li> <li id="compile">
<b>compile</b> <p>The process of turning source code into a machine-usable form. See <b>compile phase</b>.</p> </li> <li id="compile-phase">
<b>compile phase</b> <p>Any time before Perl starts running your main program. See also <b>run phase</b>. Compile phase is mostly spent in <b>compile time</b>, but may also be spent in <b>runtime</b> when <code class="inline">BEGIN</code> blocks, <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use">use</a></code> or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/no">no</a></code> declarations, or constant subexpressions are being evaluated. The startup and import code of any <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use">use</a></code> declaration is also run during compile phase.</p> </li> <li id="compiler">
<b>compiler</b> <p>Strictly speaking, a program that munches up another program and spits out yet another file containing the program in a “more executable” form, typically containing native machine instructions. The <i>perl</i> program is not a compiler by this definition, but it does contain a kind of compiler that takes a program and turns it into a more executable form (<b>syntax trees</b>) within the <i>perl</i> process itself, which the <b>interpreter</b> then interprets. There are, however, extension <b>modules</b> to get Perl to act more like a “real” compiler. See Camel chapter 16, “Compiling”.</p> </li> <li id="compile-time">
<b>compile time</b> <p>The time when Perl is trying to make sense of your code, as opposed to when it thinks it knows what your code means and is merely trying to do what it thinks your code says to do, which is <b>runtime</b>.</p> </li> <li id="composer">
<b>composer</b> <p>A “constructor” for a <b>referent</b> that isn’t really an <b>object</b>, like an anonymous array or a hash (or a sonata, for that matter). For example, a pair of braces acts as a composer for a hash, and a pair of brackets acts as a composer for an array. See the section “Creating References” in Camel chapter 8, “References”.</p> </li> <li id="concatenation">
<b>concatenation</b> <p>The process of gluing one cat’s nose to another cat’s tail. Also a similar operation on two <b>strings</b>.</p> </li> <li id="conditional">
<b>conditional</b> <p>Something “iffy”. See <b>Boolean context</b>.</p> </li> <li id="connection">
<b>connection</b> <p>In telephony, the temporary electrical circuit between the caller’s and the callee’s phone. In networking, the same kind of temporary circuit between a <b>client</b> and a <b>server</b>.</p> </li> <li id="construct">
<b>construct</b> <p>As a noun, a piece of syntax made up of smaller pieces. As a transitive verb, to create an <b>object</b> using a <b>constructor</b>.</p> </li> <li id="constructor">
<b>constructor</b> <p>Any <b>class method</b>, <b>instance</b>, or <b>subroutine</b> that composes, initializes, blesses, and returns an <b>object</b>. Sometimes we use the term loosely to mean a <b>composer</b>.</p> </li> <li id="context">
<b>context</b> <p>The surroundings or environment. The context given by the surrounding code determines what kind of data a particular <b>expression</b> is expected to return. The three primary contexts are <b>list context</b>, <b>scalar</b>, and <b>void context</b>. Scalar context is sometimes subdivided into <b>Boolean context</b>, <b>numeric context</b>, <b>string context</b>, and <b>void context</b>. There’s also a “don’t care” context (which is dealt with in Camel chapter 2, “Bits and Pieces”, if you care).</p> </li> <li id="continuation">
<b>continuation</b> <p>The treatment of more than one physical <b>line</b> as a single logical line. <b>Makefile</b> lines are continued by putting a backslash before the <b>newline</b>. Mail headers, as defined by RFC 822, are continued by putting a space or tab <i>after</i> the newline. In general, lines in Perl do not need any form of continuation mark, because <b>whitespace</b> (including newlines) is gleefully ignored. Usually.</p> </li> <li id="core-dump">
<b>core dump</b> <p>The corpse of a <b>process</b>, in the form of a file left in the <b>working directory</b> of the process, usually as a result of certain kinds of fatal errors.</p> </li> <li id="CPAN">
<b>CPAN</b> <p>The Comprehensive Perl Archive Network. (See the Camel Preface and Camel chapter 19, “CPAN” for details.)</p> </li> <li id="C-preprocessor">
<b>C preprocessor</b> <p>The typical C compiler’s first pass, which processes lines beginning with <code class="inline"><span class="c">#</span></code> for conditional compilation and macro definition, and does various manipulations of the program text based on the current definitions. Also known as <i>cpp</i>(1).</p> </li> <li id="cracker">
<b>cracker</b> <p>Someone who breaks security on computer systems. A cracker may be a true <b>hacker</b> or only a <b>script kiddie</b>.</p> </li> <li id="currently-selected-output-channel">
<b>currently selected output channel</b> <p>The last <b>filehandle</b> that was designated with <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/select">select(FILEHANDLE)</a></code>; <code class="inline"><span class="w">STDOUT</span></code> , if no filehandle has been selected.</p> </li> <li id="current-package">
<b>current package</b> <p>The <b>package</b> in which the current statement is <b>compiled</b>. Scan backward in the text of your program through the current <b>lexical scope</b> or any enclosing lexical scopes until you find a package declaration. That’s your current package name.</p> </li> <li id="current-working-directory">
<b>current working directory</b> <p>See <b>working directory</b>.</p> </li> <li id="CV">
<b>CV</b> <p>In academia, a curriculum vitæ, a fancy kind of résumé. In Perl, an internal “code value” typedef holding a <b>subroutine</b>. The <code class="inline"><span class="w">CV</span></code> type is a subclass of <b>SV</b>.</p> </li> </ul> <h3 id="D">D</h3> <ul> <li id="dangling-statement">
<b>dangling statement</b> <p>A bare, single <b>statement</b>, without any braces, hanging off an <code class="inline">if</code> or <code class="inline">while</code> conditional. C allows them. Perl doesn’t.</p> </li> <li id="datagram">
<b>datagram</b> <p>A packet of data, such as a <b>UDP</b> message, that (from the viewpoint of the programs involved) can be sent independently over the network. (In fact, all packets are sent independently at the <b>IP</b> level, but <b>stream</b> protocols such as <b>TCP</b> hide this from your program.)</p> </li> <li id="data-structure">
<b>data structure</b> <p>How your various pieces of data relate to each other and what shape they make when you put them all together, as in a rectangular table or a triangular tree.</p> </li> <li id="data-type">
<b>data type</b> <p>A set of possible values, together with all the operations that know how to deal with those values. For example, a numeric data type has a certain set of numbers that you can work with, as well as various mathematical operations that you can do on the numbers, but would make little sense on, say, a string such as <code class="inline"><span class="q">"Kilroy"</span></code> . Strings have their own operations, such as <b>concatenation</b>. Compound types made of a number of smaller pieces generally have operations to compose and decompose them, and perhaps to rearrange them. <b>Objects</b> that model things in the real world often have operations that correspond to real activities. For instance, if you model an elevator, your elevator object might have an <code class="inline"><span class="w">open_door</span></code> <b>method</b>.</p> </li> <li id="DBM">
<b>DBM</b> <p>Stands for “Database Management” routines, a set of routines that emulate an <b>associative array</b> using disk files. The routines use a dynamic hashing scheme to locate any entry with only two disk accesses. DBM files allow a Perl program to keep a persistent <b>hash</b> across multiple invocations. You can <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/tie">tie</a></code> your hash variables to various DBM implementations.</p> </li> <li id="declaration">
<b>declaration</b> <p>An <b>assertion</b> that states something exists and perhaps describes what it’s like, without giving any commitment as to how or where you’ll use it. A declaration is like the part of your recipe that says, “two cups flour, one large egg, four or five tadpoles…” See <b>statement</b> for its opposite. Note that some declarations also function as statements. Subroutine declarations also act as definitions if a body is supplied.</p> </li> <li id="declarator">
<b>declarator</b> <p>Something that tells your program what sort of variable you’d like. Perl doesn’t require you to declare variables, but you can use <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/my">my</a></code>, <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/our">our</a></code>, or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/state">state</a></code> to denote that you want something other than the default.</p> </li> <li id="decrement">
<b>decrement</b> <p>To subtract a value from a variable, as in “decrement <code class="inline"><span class="i">$x</span></code> ” (meaning to remove 1 from its value) or “decrement <code class="inline"><span class="i">$x</span></code> by 3”.</p> </li> <li id="default">
<b>default</b> <p>A <b>value</b> chosen for you if you don’t supply a value of your own.</p> </li> <li id="defined">
<b>defined</b> <p>Having a meaning. Perl thinks that some of the things people try to do are devoid of meaning; in particular, making use of variables that have never been given a <b>value</b> and performing certain operations on data that isn’t there. For example, if you try to read data past the end of a file, Perl will hand you back an undefined value. See also <b>false</b> and the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/defined">defined</a></code> entry in Camel chapter 27, “Functions”.</p> </li> <li id="delimiter">
<b>delimiter</b> <p>A <b>character</b> or <b>string</b> that sets bounds to an arbitrarily sized textual object, not to be confused with a <b>separator</b> or <b>terminator</b>. “To delimit” really just means “to surround” or “to enclose” (like these parentheses are doing).</p> </li> <li id="dereference">
<b>dereference</b> <p>A fancy computer science term meaning “to follow a <b>reference</b> to what it points to”. The “de” part of it refers to the fact that you’re taking away one level of <b>indirection</b>.</p> </li> <li id="derived-class">
<b>derived class</b> <p>A <b>class</b> that defines some of its <b>methods</b> in terms of a more generic class, called a <b>base class</b>. Note that classes aren’t classified exclusively into base classes or derived classes: a class can function as both a derived class and a base class simultaneously, which is kind of classy.</p> </li> <li id="descriptor">
<b>descriptor</b> <p>See <b>file descriptor</b>.</p> </li> <li id="destroy">
<b>destroy</b> <p>To deallocate the memory of a <b>referent</b> (first triggering its <code class="inline">DESTROY</code> method, if it has one).</p> </li> <li id="destructor">
<b>destructor</b> <p>A special <b>method</b> that is called when an <b>object</b> is thinking about <b>destroying</b> itself. A Perl program’s <code class="inline">DESTROY</code> method doesn’t do the actual destruction; Perl just <b>triggers</b> the method in case the <b>class</b> wants to do any associated cleanup.</p> </li> <li id="device">
<b>device</b> <p>A whiz-bang hardware gizmo (like a disk or tape drive or a modem or a joystick or a mouse) attached to your computer, which the <b>operating system</b> tries to make look like a <b>file</b> (or a bunch of files). Under Unix, these fake files tend to live in the <i>/dev</i> directory.</p> </li> <li id="directive">
<b>directive</b> <p>A <b>pod</b> directive. See Camel chapter 23, “Plain Old Documentation”.</p> </li> <li id="directory">
<b>directory</b> <p>A special file that contains other files. Some <b>operating systems</b> call these “folders”, “drawers”, “catalogues”, or “catalogs”.</p> </li> <li id="directory-handle">
<b>directory handle</b> <p>A name that represents a particular instance of opening a directory to read it, until you close it. See the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/opendir">opendir</a></code> function.</p> </li> <li id="discipline">
<b>discipline</b> <p>Some people need this and some people avoid it. For Perl, it’s an old way to say <b>I/O layer</b>.</p> </li> <li id="dispatch">
<b>dispatch</b> <p>To send something to its correct destination. Often used metaphorically to indicate a transfer of programmatic control to a destination selected algorithmically, often by lookup in a table of function <b>references</b> or, in the case of object <b>methods</b>, by traversing the inheritance tree looking for the most specific definition for the method.</p> </li> <li id="distribution">
<b>distribution</b> <p>A standard, bundled release of a system of software. The default usage implies source code is included. If that is not the case, it will be called a “binary-only” distribution.</p> </li> <li id="dual-lived">
<b>dual-lived</b> <p>Some modules live both in the <b>Standard Library</b> and on <b>CPAN</b>. These modules might be developed on two tracks as people modify either version. The trend currently is to untangle these situations.</p> </li> <li id="dweomer">
<b>dweomer</b> <p>An enchantment, illusion, phantasm, or jugglery. Said when Perl’s magical <b>dwimmer</b> effects don’t do what you expect, but rather seem to be the product of arcane <i>dweomercraft</i>, sorcery, or wonder working. [From Middle English.]</p> </li> <li id="dwimmer">
<b>dwimmer</b> <p>DWIM is an acronym for “Do What I Mean”, the principle that something should just do what you want it to do without an undue amount of fuss. A bit of code that does “dwimming” is a “dwimmer”. Dwimming can require a great deal of behind-the-scenes magic, which (if it doesn’t stay properly behind the scenes) is called a <b>dweomer</b> instead.</p> </li> <li id="dynamic-scoping">
<b>dynamic scoping</b> <p>Dynamic scoping works over a <b>dynamic scope</b>, making variables visible throughout the rest of the <b>block</b> in which they are first used and in any <b>subroutines</b> that are called by the rest of the block. Dynamically scoped variables can have their values temporarily changed (and implicitly restored later) by a <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/local">local</a></code> operator. (Compare <b>lexical scoping</b>.) Used more loosely to mean how a subroutine that is in the middle of calling another subroutine “contains” that subroutine at <b>runtime</b>.</p> </li> </ul> <h3 id="E">E</h3> <ul> <li id="eclectic">
<b>eclectic</b> <p>Derived from many sources. Some would say <i>too</i> many.</p> </li> <li id="element">

Variable-width fields are usually split up by <b>separators</b> (so use <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/split">split</a></code> to extract the fields), while fixed-width fields are usually at fixed positions (so use <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/unpack">unpack</a></code>). <b>Instance variables</b> are also known as “fields”.</p> </li> <li id="FIFO">
<b>FIFO</b> <p>First In, First Out. See also <b>LIFO</b>. Also a nickname for a <b>named pipe</b>.</p> </li> <li id="file">
<b>file</b> <p>A named collection of data, usually stored on disk in a <b>directory</b> in a <b>filesystem</b>. Roughly like a document, if you’re into office metaphors. In modern filesystems, you can actually give a file more than one name. Some files have special properties, like directories and devices.</p> </li> <li id="file-descriptor">
<b>file descriptor</b> <p>The little number the <b>operating system</b> uses to keep track of which opened <b>file</b> you’re talking about. Perl hides the file descriptor inside a <b>standard I/O</b> stream and then attaches the stream to a <b>filehandle</b>.</p> </li> <li id="fileglob">
<b>fileglob</b> <p>A “wildcard” match on <b>filenames</b>. See the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/glob">glob</a></code> function.</p> </li> <li id="filehandle">
<b>filehandle</b> <p>An identifier (not necessarily related to the real name of a file) that represents a particular instance of opening a file, until you close it. If you’re going to open and close several different files in succession, it’s fine to open each of them with the same filehandle, so you don’t have to write out separate code to process each file.</p> </li> <li id="filename">
<b>filename</b> <p>One name for a file. This name is listed in a <b>directory</b>. You can use it in an <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/open">open</a></code> to tell the <b>operating system</b> exactly which file you want to open, and associate the file with a <b>filehandle</b>, which will carry the subsequent identity of that file in your program, until you close it.</p> </li> <li id="filesystem">
<b>filesystem</b> <p>A set of <b>directories</b> and <b>files</b> residing on a partition of the disk. Sometimes known as a “partition”. You can change the file’s name or even move a file around from directory to directory within a filesystem without actually moving the file itself, at least under Unix.</p> </li> <li id="file-test-operator">
<b>file test operator</b> <p>A built-in unary operator that you use to determine whether something is <b>true</b> about a file, such as <code class="inline"><span class="q">–o</span>
<span class="q">$filename</span></code> to test whether you’re the owner of the file.</p> </li> <li id="filter">
<b>filter</b> <p>A program designed to take a <b>stream</b> of input and transform it into a stream of output.</p> </li> <li id="first-come">
<b>first-come</b> <p>The first <b>PAUSE</b> author to upload a <b>namespace</b> automatically becomes the <b>primary maintainer</b> for that namespace. The “first come” permissions distinguish a <b>primary maintainer</b> who was assigned that role from one who received it automatically.</p> </li> <li id="flag">
<b>flag</b> <p>We tend to avoid this term because it means so many things. It may mean a command-line <b>switch</b> that takes no argument itself (such as Perl’s <code class="inline"><span class="q">–n</span></code> and <code class="inline"><span class="q">–p</span></code> flags) or, less frequently, a single-bit indicator (such as the <code class="inline"><span class="w">O_CREAT</span></code> and <code class="inline"><span class="w">O_EXCL</span></code> flags used in <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/sysopen">sysopen</a></code>). Sometimes informally used to refer to certain regex modifiers.</p> </li> <li id="floating-point">
<b>floating point</b> <p>A method of storing numbers in “scientific notation”, such that the precision of the number is independent of its magnitude (the decimal point “floats”). Perl does its numeric work with floating-point numbers (sometimes called “floats”) when it can’t get away with using <b>integers</b>. Floating-point numbers are mere approximations of real numbers.</p> </li> <li id="flush">
<b>flush</b> <p>The act of emptying a <b>buffer</b>, often before it’s full.</p> </li> <li id="FMTEYEWTK">
<b>FMTEYEWTK</b> <p>Far More Than Everything You Ever Wanted To Know. An exhaustive treatise on one narrow topic, something of a super-<b>FAQ</b>. See Tom for far more.</p> </li> <li id="foldcase">
<b>foldcase</b> <p>The casemap used in Unicode when comparing or matching without regard to case. Comparing lower-, title-, or uppercase are all unreliable due to Unicode’s complex, one-to-many case mappings. Foldcase is a <b>lowercase</b> variant (using a partially decomposed <b>normalization</b> form for certain codepoints) created specifically to resolve this.</p> </li> <li id="fork">
<b>fork</b> <p>To create a child <b>process</b> identical to the parent process at its moment of conception, at least until it gets ideas of its own. A thread with protected memory.</p> </li> <li id="formal-arguments">
<b>formal arguments</b> <p>The generic names by which a <b>subroutine</b> knows its <b>arguments</b>. In many languages, formal arguments are always given individual names; in Perl, the formal arguments are just the elements of an array. The formal arguments to a Perl program are <code class="inline"><span class="i">$ARGV</span>[<span class="n">0</span>]</code> , <code class="inline"><span class="i">$ARGV</span>[<span class="n">1</span>]</code> , and so on. Similarly, the formal arguments to a Perl subroutine are <code class="inline"><span class="i">$_</span>[<span class="n">0</span>]</code> , <code class="inline"><span class="i">$_</span>[<span class="n">1</span>]</code> , and so on. You may give the arguments individual names by assigning the values to a <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/my">my</a></code> list. See also <b>actual arguments</b>.</p> </li> <li id="format">
<b>format</b> <p>A specification of how many spaces and digits and things to put somewhere so that whatever you’re printing comes out nice and pretty.</p> </li> <li id="freely-available">
<b>freely available</b> <p>Means you don’t have to pay money to get it, but the copyright on it may still belong to someone else (like Larry).</p> </li> <li id="freely-redistributable">
<b>freely redistributable</b> <p>Means you’re not in legal trouble if you give a bootleg copy of it to your friends and we find out about it. In fact, we’d rather you gave a copy to all your friends.</p> </li> <li id="freeware">
<b>freeware</b> <p>Historically, any software that you give away, particularly if you make the source code available as well. Now often called <b>open source software</b>. Recently there has been a trend to use the term in contradistinction to <b>open source software</b>, to refer only to free software released under the Free Software Foundation’s GPL (General Public License), but this is difficult to justify etymologically.</p> </li> <li id="function">
<b>function</b> <p>Mathematically, a mapping of each of a set of input values to a particular output value. In computers, refers to a <b>subroutine</b> or <b>operator</b> that returns a <b>value</b>. It may or may not have input values (called <b>arguments</b>).</p> </li> <li id="funny-character">
<b>funny character</b> <p>Someone like Larry, or one of his peculiar friends. Also refers to the strange prefixes that Perl requires as noun markers on its variables.</p> </li> </ul> <h3 id="G">G</h3> <ul> <li id="garbage-collection">
<b>garbage collection</b> <p>A misnamed feature—it should be called, “expecting your mother to pick up after you”. Strictly speaking, Perl doesn’t do this, but it relies on a reference-counting mechanism to keep things tidy. However, we rarely speak strictly and will often refer to the reference-counting scheme as a form of garbage collection. (If it’s any comfort, when your interpreter exits, a “real” garbage collector runs to make sure everything is cleaned up if you’ve been messy with circular references and such.)</p> </li> <li id="GID">
<b>GID</b> <p>Group ID—in Unix, the numeric group ID that the <b>operating system</b> uses to identify you and members of your <b>group</b>.</p> </li> <li id="glob">
<b>glob</b> <p>Strictly, the shell’s <code class="inline"><span class="i">*</span></code> character, which will match a “glob” of characters when you’re trying to generate a list of filenames. Loosely, the act of using globs and similar symbols to do pattern matching. See also <b>fileglob</b> and <b>typeglob</b>.</p> </li> <li id="global">
<b>global</b> <p>Something you can see from anywhere, usually used of <b>variables</b> and <b>subroutines</b> that are visible everywhere in your program. In Perl, only certain special variables are truly global—most variables (and all subroutines) exist only in the current <b>package</b>. Global variables can be declared with <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/our">our</a></code>. See “Global Declarations” in Camel chapter 4, “Statements and Declarations”.</p> </li> <li id="global-destruction">
<b>global destruction</b> <p>The <b>garbage collection</b> of globals (and the running of any associated object destructors) that takes place when a Perl <b>interpreter</b> is being shut down. Global destruction should not be confused with the Apocalypse, except perhaps when it should.</p> </li> <li id="glue-language">
<b>glue language</b> <p>A language such as Perl that is good at hooking things together that weren’t intended to be hooked together.</p> </li> <li id="granularity">
<b>granularity</b> <p>The size of the pieces you’re dealing with, mentally speaking.</p> </li> <li id="grapheme">
<b>grapheme</b> <p>A graphene is an allotrope of carbon arranged in a hexagonal crystal lattice one atom thick. A <b>grapheme</b>, or more fully, a <i>grapheme cluster string</i> is a single user-visible <b>character</b>, which may in turn be several characters (<b>codepoints</b>) long. For example, a carriage return plus a line feed is a single grapheme but two characters, while a “ȫ” is a single grapheme but one, two, or even three characters, depending on <b>normalization</b>.</p> </li> <li id="greedy">
<b>greedy</b> <p>A <b>subpattern</b> whose <b>quantifier</b> wants to match as many things as possible.</p> </li> <li id="grep">
<b>grep</b> <p>Originally from the old Unix editor command for “Globally search for a Regular Expression and Print it”, now used in the general sense of any kind of search, especially text searches. Perl has a built-in <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/grep">grep</a></code> function that searches a list for elements matching any given criterion, whereas the <b>grep</b>(1) program searches for lines matching a <b>regular expression</b> in one or more files.</p> </li> <li id="group">
<b>group</b> <p>A set of users of which you are a member. In some operating systems (like Unix), you can give certain file access permissions to other members of your group.</p> </li> <li id="GV">
<b>GV</b> <p>An internal “glob value” typedef, holding a <b>typeglob</b>. The <code class="inline"><span class="w">GV</span></code> type is a subclass of <b>SV</b>.</p> </li> </ul> <h3 id="H">H</h3> <ul> <li id="hacker">
<b>hacker</b> <p>Someone who is brilliantly persistent in solving technical problems, whether these involve golfing, fighting orcs, or programming. Hacker is a neutral term, morally speaking. Good hackers are not to be confused with evil <b>crackers</b> or clueless <b>script kiddies</b>. If you confuse them, we will presume that you are either evil or clueless.</p> </li> <li id="handler">
<b>handler</b> <p>A <b>subroutine</b> or <b>method</b> that Perl calls when your program needs to respond to some internal event, such as a <b>signal</b>, or an encounter with an operator subject to <b>operator overloading</b>. See also <b>callback</b>.</p> </li> <li id="hard-reference">
<b>hard reference</b> <p>A <b>scalar</b> <b>value</b> containing the actual address of a <b>referent</b>, such that the referent’s <b>reference</b> count accounts for it. (Some hard references are held internally, such as the implicit reference from one of a <b>typeglob</b>’s variable slots to its corresponding referent.) A hard reference is different from a <b>symbolic reference</b>.</p> </li> <li id="hash">
<b>hash</b> <p>An unordered association of <b>key</b>/<b>value</b> pairs, stored such that you can easily use a string <b>key</b> to look up its associated data <b>value</b>. This glossary is like a hash, where the word to be defined is the key and the definition is the value. A hash is also sometimes septisyllabically called an “associative array”, which is a pretty good reason for simply calling it a “hash” instead.</p> </li> <li id="hash-table">
<b>hash table</b> <p>A data structure used internally by Perl for implementing associative arrays (hashes) efficiently. See also <b>bucket</b>.</p> </li> <li id="header-file">
<b>header file</b> <p>A file containing certain required definitions that you must include “ahead” of the rest of your program to do certain obscure operations. A C header file has a <i>.h</i> extension. Perl doesn’t really have header files, though historically Perl has sometimes used translated <i>.h</i> files with a <i>.ph</i> extension. See <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/require">require</a></code> in Camel chapter 27, “Functions”. (Header files have been superseded by the <b>module</b> mechanism.)</p> </li> <li id="here-document">
<b>here document</b> <p>So called because of a similar construct in <b>shells</b> that pretends that the <b>lines</b> following the <b>command</b> are a separate <b>file</b> to be fed to the command, up to some terminating string. In Perl, however, it’s just a fancy form of quoting.</p> </li> <li id="hexadecimal">
<b>hexadecimal</b> <p>A number in base 16, “hex” for short. The digits for 10 through 15 are customarily represented by the letters <code class="inline"><span class="w">a</span></code> through <code class="inline"><span class="w">f</span></code> . Hexadecimal constants in Perl start with <code class="inline"><span class="n">0</span>x</code> . See also the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/hex">hex</a></code> function in Camel chapter 27, “Functions”.</p> </li> <li id="home-directory">
<b>home directory</b> <p>The directory you are put into when you log in. On a Unix system, the name is often placed into <code class="inline"><span class="i">$ENV</span>{<span class="w">HOME</span>}</code> or <code class="inline"><span class="i">$ENV</span>{<span class="w">LOGDIR</span>}</code> by <i>login</i>, but you can also find it with <code class="inline"><span class="s">(</span><span class="w">get</span></code> <code class="inline"><span class="i">pwuid</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="i">$&lt;</span><span class="s">)</span><span class="p">)</span>[<span class="n">7</span>]</code> . (Some platforms do not have a concept of a home directory.)</p> </li> <li id="host">
<b>host</b> <p>The computer on which a program or other data resides.</p> </li> <li id="hubris">
<b>hubris</b> <p>Excessive pride, the sort of thing for which Zeus zaps you. Also the quality that makes you write (and maintain) programs that other people won’t want to say bad things about. Hence, the third great virtue of a programmer. See also <b>laziness</b> and <b>impatience</b>.</p> </li> <li id="HV">
<b>HV</b> <p>Short for a “hash value” typedef, which holds Perl’s internal representation of a hash. The <code class="inline"><span class="w">HV</span></code> type is a subclass of <b>SV</b>.</p> </li> </ul> <h3 id="I">I</h3> <ul> <li id="identifier">
<b>identifier</b> <p>A legally formed name for most anything in which a computer program might be interested. Many languages (including Perl) allow identifiers to start with an alphabetic character, and then contain alphabetics and digits. Perl also allows connector punctuation like the underscore character wherever it allows alphabetics. (Perl also has more complicated names, like <b>qualified</b> names.)</p> </li> <li id="impatience">
<b>impatience</b> <p>The anger you feel when the computer is being lazy. This makes you write programs that don’t just react to your needs, but actually anticipate them. Or at least that pretend to. Hence, the second great virtue of a programmer. See also <b>laziness</b> and <b>hubris</b>.</p> </li> <li id="implementation">
<b>implementation</b> <p>How a piece of code actually goes about doing its job. Users of the code should not count on implementation details staying the same unless they are part of the published <b>interface</b>.</p> </li> <li id="import">
<b>import</b> <p>To gain access to symbols that are exported from another module. See <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use">use</a></code> in Camel chapter 27, “Functions”.</p> </li> <li id="increment">
<b>increment</b> <p>To increase the value of something by 1 (or by some other number, if so specified).</p> </li> <li id="indexing">
<b>indexing</b> <p>In olden days, the act of looking up a <b>key</b> in an actual index (such as a phone book). But now it's merely the act of using any kind of key or position to find the corresponding <b>value</b>, even if no index is involved. Things have degenerated to the point that Perl’s <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/index">index</a></code> function merely locates the position (index) of one string in another.</p> </li> <li id="indirect-filehandle">
<b>indirect filehandle</b> <p>An <b>expression</b> that evaluates to something that can be used as a <b>filehandle</b>: a <b>string</b> (filehandle name), a <b>typeglob</b>, a typeglob <b>reference</b>, or a low-level <b>IO</b> object.</p> </li> <li id="indirection">
<b>indirection</b> <p>If something in a program isn’t the value you’re looking for but indicates where the value is, that’s indirection. This can be done with either <b>symbolic references</b> or <b>hard</b>.</p> </li> <li id="indirect-object">
<b>indirect object</b> <p>In English grammar, a short noun phrase between a verb and its direct object indicating the beneficiary or recipient of the action. In Perl, <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/print">print</a> <span class="i">STDOUT</span> <span class="q">"$foo\n"</span><span class="sc">;</span></code> can be understood as “verb indirect-object object”, where <code class="inline"><span class="w">STDOUT</span></code> is the recipient of the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/print">print</a></code> action, and <code class="inline"><span class="q">"$foo"</span></code> is the object being printed. Similarly, when invoking a <b>method</b>, you might place the invocant in the dative slot between the method and its arguments:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">$gollum = new Pathetic::Creature "Sméagol";
give $gollum "Fisssssh!";
give $gollum "Precious!";
</pre>
</li> <li id="indirect-object-slot">
<b>indirect object slot</b> <p>The syntactic position falling between a method call and its arguments when using the indirect object invocation syntax. (The slot is distinguished by the absence of a comma between it and the next argument.) <code class="inline"><span class="w">STDERR</span></code> is in the indirect object slot here:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">print STDERR "Awake! Awake! Fear, Fire, Foes! Awake!\n";
</pre>
</li> <li id="infix">
<b>infix</b> <p>An <b>operator</b> that comes in between its <b>operands</b>, such as multiplication in <code class="inline"><span class="n">24</span> * <span class="n">7</span></code> .</p> </li> <li id="inheritance">
<b>inheritance</b> <p>What you get from your ancestors, genetically or otherwise. If you happen to be a <b>class</b>, your ancestors are called <b>base classes</b> and your descendants are called <b>derived classes</b>. See <b>single inheritance</b> and <b>multiple inheritance</b>.</p> </li> <li id="instance">
<b>instance</b> <p>Short for “an instance of a class”, meaning an <b>object</b> of that <b>class</b>.</p> </li> <li id="instance-data">
<b>instance data</b> <p>See <b>instance variable</b>.</p> </li> <li id="instance-method">
<b>instance method</b> <p>A <b>method</b> of an <b>object</b>, as opposed to a <b>class method</b>.</p> <p>A <b>method</b> whose <b>invocant</b> is an <b>object</b>, not a <b>package</b> name. Every object of a class shares all the methods of that class, so an instance method applies to all instances of the class, rather than applying to a particular instance. Also see <b>class method</b>.</p> </li> <li id="instance-variable">
<b>instance variable</b> <p>An <b>attribute</b> of an <b>object</b>; data stored with the particular object rather than with the class as a whole.</p> </li> <li id="integer">
<b>integer</b> <p>A number with no fractional (decimal) part. A counting number, like 1, 2, 3, and so on, but including 0 and the negatives.</p> </li> <li id="interface">
<b>interface</b> <p>The services a piece of code promises to provide forever, in contrast to its <b>implementation</b>, which it should feel free to change whenever it likes.</p> </li> <li id="interpolation">
<b>interpolation</b> <p>The insertion of a scalar or list value somewhere in the middle of another value, such that it appears to have been there all along. In Perl, variable interpolation happens in double-quoted strings and patterns, and list interpolation occurs when constructing the list of values to pass to a list operator or other such construct that takes a <i><code class="inline"><span class="w">LIST</span></code> </i>.</p> </li> <li id="interpreter">
<b>interpreter</b> <p>Strictly speaking, a program that reads a second program and does what the second program says directly without turning the program into a different form first, which is what <b>compilers</b> do. Perl is not an interpreter by this definition, because it contains a kind of compiler that takes a program and turns it into a more executable form (<b>syntax trees</b>) within the <i>perl</i> process itself, which the Perl <b>runtime</b> system then interprets.</p> </li> <li id="invocant">
<b>invocant</b> <p>The agent on whose behalf a <b>method</b> is invoked. In a <b>class</b> method, the invocant is a package name. In an <b>instance</b> method, the invocant is an object reference.</p> </li> <li id="invocation">
<b>invocation</b> <p>The act of calling up a deity, daemon, program, method, subroutine, or function to get it to do what you think it’s supposed to do. We usually “call” subroutines but “invoke” methods, since it sounds cooler.</p> </li> <li id="I%2fO">
<b>I/O</b> <p>Input from, or output to, a <b>file</b> or <b>device</b>.</p> </li> <li id="IO">
<b>IO</b> <p>An internal I/O object. Can also mean <b>indirect object</b>.</p> </li> <li id="I%2fO-layer">

<b>IP</b> <p>Internet Protocol, or Intellectual Property.</p> </li> <li id="IPC">
<b>IPC</b> <p>Interprocess Communication.</p> </li> <li id="is-a">
<b>is-a</b> <p>A relationship between two <b>objects</b> in which one object is considered to be a more specific version of the other, generic object: “A camel is a mammal.” Since the generic object really only exists in a Platonic sense, we usually add a little abstraction to the notion of objects and think of the relationship as being between a generic <b>base class</b> and a specific <b>derived class</b>. Oddly enough, Platonic classes don’t always have Platonic relationships—see <b>inheritance</b>.</p> </li> <li id="iteration">
<b>iteration</b> <p>Doing something repeatedly.</p> </li> <li id="iterator">
<b>iterator</b> <p>A special programming gizmo that keeps track of where you are in something that you’re trying to iterate over.

<b>line number</b> <p>The number of lines read previous to this one, plus 1. Perl keeps a separate line number for each source or input file it opens. The current source file’s line number is represented by <code class="inline"><span class="w">__LINE__</span></code> . The current input line number (for the file that was most recently read via <code class="inline"><span class="q">&lt;FH&gt;</span></code> ) is represented by the <code class="inline"><span class="i">$.</span></code> (<code class="inline"><span class="i">$INPUT_LINE_NUMBER</span></code> ) variable.

As a verb, to resolve a partially <b>compiled</b> file’s unresolved symbols into a (nearly) executable image. Linking can generally be static or dynamic, which has nothing to do with static or dynamic scoping.</p> </li> <li id="LIST">
<b>LIST</b> <p>A syntactic construct representing a comma- separated list of expressions, evaluated to produce a <b>list value</b>. Each <b>expression</b> in a <i><code class="inline"><span class="w">LIST</span></code> </i> is evaluated in <b>list context</b> and interpolated into the list value.</p> </li> <li id="list">
<b>list</b> <p>An ordered set of scalar values.</p> </li> <li id="list-context">
<b>list context</b> <p>The situation in which an <b>expression</b> is expected by its surroundings (the code calling it) to return a list of values rather than a single value. Functions that want a <i><code class="inline"><span class="w">LIST</span></code> </i> of arguments tell those arguments that they should produce a list value. See also <b>context</b>.</p> </li> <li id="list-operator">
<b>list operator</b> <p>An <b>operator</b> that does something with a list of values, such as <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/join">join</a></code> or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/grep">grep</a></code>. Usually used for named built-in operators (such as <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/print">print</a></code>, <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/unlink">unlink</a></code>, and <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/system">system</a></code>) that do not require parentheses around their <b>argument</b> list.</p> </li> <li id="list-value">
<b>list value</b> <p>An unnamed list of temporary scalar values that may be passed around within a program from any list-generating function to any function or construct that provides a <b>list context</b>.</p> </li> <li id="literal">
<b>literal</b> <p>A token in a programming language, such as a number or <b>string</b>, that gives you an actual <b>value</b> instead of merely representing possible values as a <b>variable</b> does.</p> </li> <li id="little-endian">
<b>little-endian</b> <p>From Swift: someone who eats eggs little end first. Also used of computers that store the least significant <b>byte</b> of a word at a lower byte address than the most significant byte. Often considered superior to big-endian machines. See also <b>big-endian</b>.</p> </li> <li id="local">
<b>local</b> <p>Not meaning the same thing everywhere. A global variable in Perl can be localized inside a <b>dynamic scope</b> via the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/local">local</a></code> operator.</p> </li> <li id="logical-operator">
<b>logical operator</b> <p>Symbols representing the concepts “and”, “or”, “xor”, and “not”.</p> </li> <li id="lookahead">
<b>lookahead</b> <p>An <b>assertion</b> that peeks at the string to the right of the current match location.</p> </li> <li id="lookbehind">

<b>loop control statement</b> <p>Any statement within the body of a loop that can make a loop prematurely stop looping or skip an <b>iteration</b>. Generally, you shouldn’t try this on roller coasters.</p> </li> <li id="loop-label">
<b>loop label</b> <p>A kind of key or name attached to a loop (or roller coaster) so that loop control statements can talk about which loop they want to control.</p> </li> <li id="lowercase">
<b>lowercase</b> <p>In Unicode, not just characters with the General Category of Lowercase Letter, but any character with the Lowercase property, including Modifier Letters, Letter Numbers, some Other Symbols, and one Combining Mark.</p> </li> <li id="lvaluable">
<b>lvaluable</b> <p>Able to serve as an <b>lvalue</b>.</p> </li> <li id="lvalue">
<b>lvalue</b> <p>Term used by language lawyers for a storage location you can assign a new <b>value</b> to, such as a <b>variable</b> or an element of an <b>array</b>. The “l” is short for “left”, as in the left side of an assignment, a typical place for lvalues. An <b>lvaluable</b> function or expression is one to which a value may be assigned, as in <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/pos">pos</a><span class="s">(</span><span class="i">$x</span><span class="s">)</span> = <span class="n">10</span></code> .</p> </li> <li id="lvalue-modifier">
<b>lvalue modifier</b> <p>An adjectival pseudofunction that warps the meaning of an <b>lvalue</b> in some declarative fashion. Currently there are three lvalue modifiers: <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/my">my</a></code>, <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/our">our</a></code>, and <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/local">local</a></code>.</p> </li> </ul> <h3 id="M">M</h3> <ul> <li id="magic">

Magical things happen when you diddle those variables.</p> </li> <li id="magical-increment">
<b>magical increment</b> <p>An <b>increment</b> operator that knows how to bump up ASCII alphabetics as well as numbers.</p> </li> <li id="magical-variables">
<b>magical variables</b> <p>Special variables that have side effects when you access them or assign to them. For example, in Perl, changing elements of the <code class="inline"><span class="i">%ENV</span></code> array also changes the corresponding environment variables that subprocesses will use. Reading the <code class="inline"><span class="i">$!</span></code> variable gives you the current system error number or message.</p> </li> <li id="Makefile">
<b>Makefile</b> <p>A file that controls the compilation of a program. Perl programs don’t usually need a <b>Makefile</b> because the Perl compiler has plenty of self-control.</p> </li> <li id="man">
<b>man</b> <p>The Unix program that displays online documentation (manual pages) for you.</p> </li> <li id="manpage">
<b>manpage</b> <p>A “page” from the manuals, typically accessed via the <i>man</i>(1) command. A manpage contains a SYNOPSIS, a DESCRIPTION, a list of BUGS, and so on, and is typically longer than a page. There are manpages documenting <b>commands</b>, <b>syscalls</b>, <b>library</b> <b>functions</b>, <b>devices</b>, <b>protocols</b>, <b>files</b>, and such. In this book, we call any piece of standard Perl documentation (like <a href="perlop">perlop</a> or <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/5.26.0/perldelta.html">perldelta</a>) a manpage, no matter what format it’s installed in on your system.</p> </li> <li id="matching">
<b>matching</b> <p>See <b>pattern matching</b>.</p> </li> <li id="member-data">
<b>member data</b> <p>See <b>instance variable</b>.</p> </li> <li id="memory">
<b>memory</b> <p>This always means your main memory, not your disk. Clouding the issue is the fact that your machine may implement <b>virtual</b> memory; that is, it will pretend that it has more memory than it really does, and it’ll use disk space to hold inactive bits. This can make it seem like you have a little more memory than you really do, but it’s not a substitute for real memory. The best thing that can be said about virtual memory is that it lets your performance degrade gradually rather than suddenly when you run out of real memory. But your program can die when you run out of virtual memory, too—if you haven’t thrashed your disk to death first.</p> </li> <li id="metacharacter">
<b>metacharacter</b> <p>A <b>character</b> that is <i>not</i> supposed to be treated normally. Which characters are to be treated specially as metacharacters varies greatly from context to context. Your <b>shell</b> will have certain metacharacters, double-quoted Perl <b>strings</b> have other metacharacters, and <b>regular expression</b> patterns have all the double-quote metacharacters plus some extra ones of their own.</p> </li> <li id="metasymbol">
<b>metasymbol</b> <p>Something we’d call a <b>metacharacter</b> except that it’s a sequence of more than one character. Generally, the first character in the sequence must be a true metacharacter to get the other characters in the metasymbol to misbehave along with it.</p> </li> <li id="method">
<b>method</b> <p>A kind of action that an <b>object</b> can take if you tell it to. See Camel chapter 12, “Objects”.</p> </li> <li id="method-resolution-order">
<b>method resolution order</b> <p>The path Perl takes through <code class="inline"><span class="i">@INC</span></code> . By default, this is a double depth first search, once looking for defined methods and once for <code class="inline">AUTOLOAD</code> . However, Perl lets you configure this with <code class="inline"><span class="w">mro</span></code> .</p> </li> <li id="minicpan">
<b>minicpan</b> <p>A CPAN mirror that includes just the latest versions for each distribution, probably created with <code class="inline"><span class="w">CPAN::Mini</span></code> . See Camel chapter 19, “CPAN”.</p> </li> <li id="minimalism">
<b>minimalism</b> <p>The belief that “small is beautiful”. Paradoxically, if you say something in a small language, it turns out big, and if you say it in a big language, it turns out small. Go figure.</p> </li> <li id="mode">
<b>mode</b> <p>In the context of the <i>stat</i>(2) syscall, refers to the field holding the <b>permission bits</b> and the type of the <b>file</b>.</p> </li> <li id="modifier">

See the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use">use</a></code> built-in.</p> </li> <li id="modulus">
<b>modulus</b> <p>An integer divisor when you’re interested in the remainder instead of the quotient.</p> </li> <li id="mojibake">
<b>mojibake</b> <p>When you speak one language and the computer thinks you’re speaking another. You’ll see odd translations when you send UTF‑8, for instance, but the computer thinks you sent Latin-1, showing all sorts of weird characters instead. The term is written 「文字化け」in Japanese and means “character rot”, an apt description. Pronounced [<code class="inline"><span class="w">modʑibake</span></code> ] in standard <b>IPA</b> phonetics, or approximately “moh-jee-bah-keh”.</p> </li> <li id="monger">
<b>monger</b> <p>Short for one member of <b>Perl mongers</b>, a purveyor of Perl.</p> </li> <li id="mortal">

<b>NaN</b> <p>Not a number. The value Perl uses for certain invalid or inexpressible floating-point operations.</p> </li> <li id="network-address">
<b>network address</b> <p>The most important attribute of a socket, like your telephone’s telephone number. Typically an IP address. See also <b>port</b>.</p> </li> <li id="newline">
<b>newline</b> <p>A single character that represents the end of a line, with the ASCII value of 012 octal under Unix (but 015 on a Mac), and represented by <code class="inline">\<span class="w">n</span></code> in Perl strings. For Windows machines writing text files, and for certain physical devices like terminals, the single newline gets automatically translated by your C library into a line feed and a carriage return, but normally, no translation is done.</p> </li> <li id="NFS">
<b>NFS</b> <p>Network File System, which allows you to mount a remote filesystem as if it were local.</p> </li> <li id="normalization">
<b>normalization</b> <p>Converting a text string into an alternate but equivalent <b>canonical</b> (or compatible) representation that can then be compared for equivalence. Unicode recognizes four different normalization forms: NFD, NFC, NFKD, and NFKC.</p> </li> <li id="null-character">
<b>null character</b> <p>A character with the numeric value of zero. It’s used by C to terminate strings, but Perl allows strings to contain a null.</p> </li> <li id="null-list">
<b>null list</b> <p>A <b>list value</b> with zero elements, represented in Perl by <code class="inline"><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code> .</p> </li> <li id="null-string">

<b>numeric context</b> <p>The situation in which an expression is expected by its surroundings (the code calling it) to return a number. See also <b>context</b> and <b>string context</b>.</p> </li> <li id="numification">
<b>numification</b> <p>(Sometimes spelled <i>nummification</i> and <i>nummify</i>.) Perl lingo for implicit conversion into a number; the related verb is <i>numify</i>. <i>Numification</i> is intended to rhyme with <i>mummification</i>, and <i>numify</i> with <i>mummify</i>. It is unrelated to English <i>numen</i>, <i>numina</i>, <i>numinous</i>. We originally forgot the extra <i>m</i> a long time ago, and some people got used to our funny spelling, and so just as with <code class="inline"><span class="w">HTTP_REFERER</span></code> ’s own missing letter, our weird spelling has stuck around.</p> </li> <li id="NV">
<b>NV</b> <p>Short for Nevada, no part of which will ever be confused with civilization. NV also means an internal floating- point Numeric Value of the type a <b>scalar</b> can hold, not to be confused with an <b>IV</b>.</p> </li> <li id="nybble">
<b>nybble</b> <p>Half a <b>byte</b>, equivalent to one <b>hexadecimal</b> digit, and worth four <b>bits</b>.</p> </li> </ul> <h3 id="O">O</h3> <ul> <li id="object">
<b>object</b> <p>An <b>instance</b> of a <b>class</b>. Something that “knows” what user-defined type (class) it is, and what it can do because of what class it is. Your program can request an object to do things, but the object gets to decide whether it wants to do them or not. Some objects are more accommodating than others.</p> </li> <li id="octal">
<b>octal</b> <p>A number in base 8. Only the digits 0 through 7 are allowed. Octal constants in Perl start with 0, as in 013. See also the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/oct">oct</a></code> function.</p> </li> <li id="offset">
<b>offset</b> <p>How many things you have to skip over when moving from the beginning of a string or array to a specific position within it. Thus, the minimum offset is zero, not one, because you don’t skip anything to get to the first item.</p> </li> <li id="one-liner">
<b>one-liner</b> <p>An entire computer program crammed into one line of text.</p> </li> <li id="open-source-software">
<b>open source software</b> <p>Programs for which the source code is freely available and freely redistributable, with no commercial strings attached. For a more detailed definition, see <a href="http://www.opensource.org/osd.html">http://www.opensource.org/osd.html</a>.</p> </li> <li id="operand">
<b>operand</b> <p>An <b>expression</b> that yields a <b>value</b> that an <b>operator</b> operates on. See also <b>precedence</b>.</p> </li> <li id="operating-system">
<b>operating system</b> <p>A special program that runs on the bare machine and hides the gory details of managing <b>processes</b> and <b>devices</b>. Usually used in a looser sense to indicate a particular culture of programming. The loose sense can be used at varying levels of specificity. At one extreme, you might say that all versions of Unix and Unix-lookalikes are the same operating system (upsetting many people, especially lawyers and other advocates). At the other extreme, you could say this particular version of this particular vendor’s operating system is different from any other version of this or any other vendor’s operating system. Perl is much more portable across operating systems than many other languages. See also <b>architecture</b> and <b>platform</b>.</p> </li> <li id="operator">
<b>operator</b> <p>A gizmo that transforms some number of input values to some number of output values, often built into a language with a special syntax or symbol. A given operator may have specific expectations about what <b>types</b> of data you give as its arguments (<b>operands</b>) and what type of data you want back from it.</p> </li> <li id="operator-overloading">
<b>operator overloading</b> <p>A kind of <b>overloading</b> that you can do on built-in <b>operators</b> to make them work on <b>objects</b> as if the objects were ordinary scalar values, but with the actual semantics supplied by the object class. This is set up with the overload <b>pragma</b>—see Camel chapter 13, “Overloading”.</p> </li> <li id="options">
<b>options</b> <p>See either <b>switches</b> or <b>regular expression modifiers</b>.</p> </li> <li id="ordinal">
<b>ordinal</b> <p>An abstract character’s integer value. Same thing as <b>codepoint</b>.</p> </li> <li id="overloading">
<b>overloading</b> <p>Giving additional meanings to a symbol or construct. Actually, all languages do overloading to one extent or another, since people are good at figuring out things from <b>context</b>.</p> </li> <li id="overriding">
<b>overriding</b> <p>Hiding or invalidating some other definition of the same name. (Not to be confused with <b>overloading</b>, which adds definitions that must be disambiguated some other way.) To confuse the issue further, we use the word with two overloaded definitions: to describe how you can define your own <b>subroutine</b> to hide a built-in <b>function</b> of the same name (see the section “Overriding Built-in Functions” in Camel chapter 11, “Modules”), and to describe how you can define a replacement <b>method</b> in a <b>derived class</b> to hide a <b>base class</b>’s method of the same name (see Camel chapter 12, “Objects”).</p> </li> <li id="owner">
<b>owner</b> <p>The one user (apart from the superuser) who has absolute control over a <b>file</b>. A file may also have a <b>group</b> of users who may exercise joint ownership if the real owner permits it. See <b>permission bits</b>.</p> </li> </ul> <h3 id="P">P</h3> <ul> <li id="package">
<b>package</b> <p>A <b>namespace</b> for global <b>variables</b>, <b>subroutines</b>, and the like, such that they can be kept separate from like-named <b>symbols</b> in other namespaces. In a sense, only the package is global, since the symbols in the package’s symbol table are only accessible from code <b>compiled</b> outside the package by naming the package. But in another sense, all package symbols are also globals—they’re just well-organized globals.</p> </li> <li id="pad">

<b>permission bits</b> <p>Bits that the <b>owner</b> of a file sets or unsets to allow or disallow access to other people. These flag bits are part of the <b>mode</b> word returned by the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/stat">stat</a></code> built-in when you ask about a file. On Unix systems, you can check the <i>ls</i>(1) manpage for more information.</p> </li> <li id="Pern">

<b>pipe</b> <p>A direct <b>connection</b> that carries the output of one <b>process</b> to the input of another without an intermediate temporary file.

<b>pipeline</b> <p>A series of <b>processes</b> all in a row, linked by <b>pipes</b>, where each passes its output stream to the next.</p> </li> <li id="platform">
<b>platform</b> <p>The entire hardware and software context in which a program runs. A program written in a platform-dependent language might break if you change any of the following: machine, operating system, libraries, compiler, or system configuration. The <i>perl</i> interpreter has to be <b>compiled</b> differently for each platform because it is implemented in C, but programs written in the Perl language are largely platform independent.</p> </li> <li id="pod">
<b>pod</b> <p>The markup used to embed documentation into your Perl code. Pod stands for “Plain old documentation”. See Camel chapter 23, “Plain Old Documentation”.</p> </li> <li id="pod-command">

<b>pointer</b> <p>A <b>variable</b> in a language like C that contains the exact memory location of some other item. Perl handles pointers internally so you don’t have to worry about them. Instead, you just use symbolic pointers in the form of <b>keys</b> and <b>variable</b> names, or <b>hard references</b>, which aren’t pointers (but act like pointers and do in fact contain pointers).</p> </li> <li id="polymorphism">
<b>polymorphism</b> <p>The notion that you can tell an <b>object</b> to do something generic, and the object will interpret the command in different ways depending on its type. [&lt; Greek πολυ- + μορϕή, many forms.]</p> </li> <li id="port">
<b>port</b> <p>The part of the address of a TCP or UDP socket that directs packets to the correct process after finding the right machine, something like the phone extension you give when you reach the company operator. Also the result of converting code to run on a different platform than originally intended, or the verb denoting this conversion.</p> </li> <li id="portable">
<b>portable</b> <p>Once upon a time, C code compilable under both BSD and SysV.

<b>procedure</b> <p>A <b>subroutine</b>.</p> </li> <li id="process">
<b>process</b> <p>An instance of a running program. Under multitasking systems like Unix, two or more separate processes could be running the same program independently at the same time—in fact, the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/fork">fork</a></code> function is designed to bring about this happy state of affairs. Under other operating systems, processes are sometimes called “threads”, “tasks”, or “jobs”, often with slight nuances in meaning.</p> </li> <li id="program">

<b>regular expression</b> <p>A single entity with various interpretations, like an elephant. To a computer scientist, it’s a grammar for a little language in which some strings are legal and others aren’t. To normal people, it’s a pattern you can use to find what you’re looking for when it varies from case to case. Perl’s regular expressions are far from regular in the theoretical sense, but in regular use they work quite well. Here’s a regular expression: <code class="inline"><span class="q">/Oh s.*t./</span></code> . This will match strings like “<code class="inline"><span class="w">Oh</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/say">say</a> <span class="i">can</span> <span class="w">you</span> <span class="w">see</span> <span class="w">by</span> <span class="w">the</span> <span class="w">dawn's</span> <span class="w">early</span> <span class="w">light</span></code> ” and “<code class="inline"><span class="w">Oh</span> <span class="w">sit</span>!</code> ”.

<b>runtime pattern</b> <p>A pattern that contains one or more variables to be interpolated before parsing the pattern as a <b>regular expression</b>, and that therefore cannot be analyzed at compile time, but must be reanalyzed each time the pattern match operator is evaluated.

<b>scalar context</b> <p>The situation in which an <b>expression</b> is expected by its surroundings (the code calling it) to return a single <b>value</b> rather than a <b>list</b> of values. See also <b>context</b> and <b>list context</b>. A scalar context sometimes imposes additional constraints on the return value—see <b>string context</b> and <b>numeric context</b>. Sometimes we talk about a <b>Boolean context</b> inside conditionals, but this imposes no additional constraints, since any scalar value, whether numeric or <b>string</b>, is already true or false.</p> </li> <li id="scalar-literal">

<b>scope</b> <p>From how far away you can see a variable, looking through one. Perl has two visibility mechanisms. It does <b>dynamic scoping</b> of <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/local">local</a></code> <b>variables</b>, meaning that the rest of the <b>block</b>, and any <b>subroutines</b> that are called by the rest of the block, can see the variables that are local to the block. Perl does <b>lexical scoping</b> of <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/my">my</a></code> variables, meaning that the rest of the block can see the variable, but other subroutines called by the block <i>cannot</i> see the variable.</p> </li> <li id="scratchpad">
<b>scratchpad</b> <p>The area in which a particular invocation of a particular file or subroutine keeps some of its temporary values, including any lexically scoped variables.</p> </li> <li id="script">
<b>script</b> <p>A text <b>file</b> that is a program intended to be <b>executed</b> directly rather than <b>compiled</b> to another form of file before <b>execution</b>.</p> <p>Also, in the context of <b>Unicode</b>, a writing system for a particular language or group of languages, such as Greek, Bengali, or Tengwar.</p> </li> <li id="script-kiddie">
<b>script kiddie</b> <p>A <b>cracker</b> who is not a <b>hacker</b> but knows just enough to run canned scripts. A <b>cargo-cult</b> programmer.</p> </li> <li id="sed">
<b>sed</b> <p>A venerable Stream EDitor from which Perl derives some of its ideas.</p> </li> <li id="semaphore">
<b>semaphore</b> <p>A fancy kind of interlock that prevents multiple <b>threads</b> or <b>processes</b> from using up the same resources simultaneously.</p> </li> <li id="separator">
<b>separator</b> <p>A <b>character</b> or <b>string</b> that keeps two surrounding strings from being confused with each other. The <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/split">split</a></code> function works on separators. Not to be confused with <b>delimiters</b> or <b>terminators</b>.

<b>service</b> <p>Something you do for someone else to make them happy, like giving them the time of day (or of their life). On some machines, well-known services are listed by the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/getservent">getservent</a></code> function.</p> </li> <li id="setgid">
<b>setgid</b> <p>Same as <b>setuid</b>, only having to do with giving away <b>group</b> privileges.</p> </li> <li id="setuid">
<b>setuid</b> <p>Said of a program that runs with the privileges of its <b>owner</b> rather than (as is usually the case) the privileges of whoever is running it. Also describes the bit in the mode word (<b>permission bits</b>) that controls the feature. This bit must be explicitly set by the owner to enable this feature, and the program must be carefully written not to give away more privileges than it ought to.</p> </li> <li id="shared-memory">
<b>shared memory</b> <p>A piece of <b>memory</b> accessible by two different <b>processes</b> who otherwise would not see each other’s memory.</p> </li> <li id="shebang">
<b>shebang</b> <p>Irish for the whole McGillicuddy. In Perl culture, a portmanteau of “sharp” and “bang”, meaning the <code class="inline"><span class="c">#!</span></code> sequence that tells the system where to find the interpreter.</p> </li> <li id="shell">
<b>shell</b> <p>A <b>command</b>-line <b>interpreter</b>. The program that interactively gives you a prompt, accepts one or more <b>lines</b> of input, and executes the programs you mentioned, feeding each of them their proper <b>arguments</b> and input data. Shells can also execute scripts containing such commands. Under Unix, typical shells include the Bourne shell (<i>/bin/sh</i>), the C shell (<i>/bin/csh</i>), and the Korn shell (<i>/bin/ksh</i>). Perl is not strictly a shell because it’s not interactive (although Perl programs can be interactive).</p> </li> <li id="side-effects">
<b>side effects</b> <p>Something extra that happens when you evaluate an <b>expression</b>. Nowadays it can refer to almost anything. For example, evaluating a simple assignment statement typically has the “side effect” of assigning a value to a variable. (And you thought assigning the value was your primary intent in the first place!) Likewise, assigning a value to the special variable <code class="inline"><span class="i">$|</span></code> (<code class="inline"><span class="i">$AUTOFLUSH</span></code> ) has the side effect of forcing a flush after every <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/write">write</a></code> or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/print">print</a></code> on the currently selected filehandle.</p> </li> <li id="sigil">
<b>sigil</b> <p>A glyph used in magic. Or, for Perl, the symbol in front of a variable name, such as <code class="inline"><span class="i">$</span></code> , <code class="inline"><span class="i">@</span></code> , and <code class="inline"><span class="i">%</span></code> .</p> </li> <li id="signal">
<b>signal</b> <p>A bolt out of the blue; that is, an event triggered by the <b>operating system</b>, probably when you’re least expecting it.</p> </li> <li id="signal-handler">
<b>signal handler</b> <p>A <b>subroutine</b> that, instead of being content to be called in the normal fashion, sits around waiting for a bolt out of the blue before it will deign to <b>execute</b>. Under Perl, bolts out of the blue are called signals, and you send them with the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/kill">kill</a></code> built-in. See the <code class="inline"><span class="i">%SIG</span></code> hash in Camel chapter 25, “Special Names” and the section “Signals” in Camel chapter 15, “Interprocess Communication”.</p> </li> <li id="single-inheritance">
<b>single inheritance</b> <p>The features you got from your mother, if she told you that you don’t have a father. (See also <b>inheritance</b> and <b>multiple inheritance</b>.) In computer languages, the idea that <b>classes</b> reproduce asexually so that a given class can only have one direct ancestor or <b>base class</b>. Perl supplies no such restriction, though you may certainly program Perl that way if you like.</p> </li> <li id="slice">
<b>slice</b> <p>A selection of any number of <b>elements</b> from a <b>list</b>, <b>array</b>, or <b>hash</b>.</p> </li> <li id="slurp">
<b>slurp</b> <p>To read an entire <b>file</b> into a <b>string</b> in one operation.</p> </li> <li id="socket">
<b>socket</b> <p>An endpoint for network communication among multiple <b>processes</b> that works much like a telephone or a post office box. The most important thing about a socket is its <b>network address</b> (like a phone number). Different kinds of sockets have different kinds of addresses—some look like filenames, and some don’t.</p> </li> <li id="soft-reference">
<b>soft reference</b> <p>See <b>symbolic reference</b>.</p> </li> <li id="source-filter">
<b>source filter</b> <p>A special kind of <b>module</b> that does <b>preprocessing</b> on your script just before it gets to the <b>tokener</b>.</p> </li> <li id="stack">

<b>standard error</b> <p>The default output <b>stream</b> for nasty remarks that don’t belong in <b>standard output</b>. Represented within a Perl program by the output&gt; <b>filehandle</b> <code class="inline"><span class="w">STDERR</span></code> . You can use this stream explicitly, but the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/die">die</a></code> and <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/warn">warn</a></code> built-ins write to your standard error stream automatically (unless trapped or otherwise intercepted).</p> </li> <li id="standard-input">
<b>standard input</b> <p>The default input <b>stream</b> for your program, which if possible shouldn’t care where its data is coming from. Represented within a Perl program by the <b>filehandle</b> <code class="inline"><span class="w">STDIN</span></code> .</p> </li> <li id="standard-I%2fO">
<b>standard I/O</b> <p>A standard C library for doing <b>buffered</b> input and output to the <b>operating system</b>. (The “standard” of standard I/O is at most marginally related to the “standard” of standard input and output.) In general, Perl relies on whatever implementation of standard I/O a given operating system supplies, so the buffering characteristics of a Perl program on one machine may not exactly match those on another machine. Normally this only influences efficiency, not semantics. If your standard I/O package is doing block buffering and you want it to <b>flush</b> the buffer more often, just set the <code class="inline"><span class="i">$|</span></code> variable to a true value.</p> </li> <li id="Standard-Library">

<b>statement</b> <p>A <b>command</b> to the computer about what to do next, like a step in a recipe: “Add marmalade to batter and mix until mixed.” A statement is distinguished from a <b>declaration</b>, which doesn’t tell the computer to do anything, but just to learn something.</p> </li> <li id="statement-modifier">
<b>statement modifier</b> <p>A <b>conditional</b> or <b>loop</b> that you put after the <b>statement</b> instead of before, if you know what we mean.</p> </li> <li id="static">
<b>static</b> <p>Varying slowly compared to something else. (Unfortunately, everything is relatively stable compared to something else, except for certain elementary particles, and we’re not so sure about them.) In computers, where things are supposed to vary rapidly, “static” has a derogatory connotation, indicating a slightly dysfunctional <b>variable</b>, <b>subroutine</b>, or <b>method</b>. In Perl culture, the word is politely avoided.</p> <p>If you’re a C or C++ programmer, you might be looking for Perl’s <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/state">state</a></code> keyword.</p> </li> <li id="static-method">

<b>SV</b> <p>Short for “scalar value”. But within the Perl interpreter, every <b>referent</b> is treated as a member of a class derived from SV, in an object-oriented sort of way. Every <b>value</b> inside Perl is passed around as a C language <code class="inline"><span class="w">SV</span>*</code> pointer.

The “symbolic” part just means that you can talk to the debugger using the same symbols with which your program is written.</p> </li> <li id="symbolic-link">
<b>symbolic link</b> <p>An alternate filename that points to the real <b>filename</b>, which in turn points to the real <b>file</b>. Whenever the <b>operating system</b> is trying to parse a <b>pathname</b> containing a symbolic link, it merely substitutes the new name and continues parsing.</p> </li> <li id="symbolic-reference">
<b>symbolic reference</b> <p>A variable whose value is the name of another variable or subroutine. By <b>dereferencing</b> the first variable, you can get at the second one. Symbolic references are illegal under <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use">use</a> <span class="w">strict</span> <span class="q">"refs"</span></code> .</p> </li> <li id="symbol-table">
<b>symbol table</b> <p>Where a <b>compiler</b> remembers symbols. A program like Perl must somehow remember all the names of all the <b>variables</b>, <b>filehandles</b>, and <b>subroutines</b> you’ve used. It does this by placing the names in a symbol table, which is implemented in Perl using a <b>hash table</b>. There is a separate symbol table for each <b>package</b> to give each package its own <b>namespace</b>.</p> </li> <li id="synchronous">
<b>synchronous</b> <p>Programming in which the orderly sequence of events can be determined; that is, when things happen one after the other, not at the same time.</p> </li> <li id="syntactic-sugar">
<b>syntactic sugar</b> <p>An alternative way of writing something more easily; a shortcut.</p> </li> <li id="syntax">
<b>syntax</b> <p>From Greek σύνταξις, “with-arrangement”. How things (particularly symbols) are put together with each other.</p> </li> <li id="syntax-tree">
<b>syntax tree</b> <p>An internal representation of your program wherein lower-level <b>constructs</b> dangle off the higher-level constructs enclosing them.</p> </li> <li id="syscall">
<b>syscall</b> <p>A <b>function</b> call directly to the <b>operating system</b>. Many of the important subroutines and functions you use aren’t direct system calls, but are built up in one or more layers above the system call level. In general, Perl programmers don’t need to worry about the distinction. However, if you do happen to know which Perl functions are really syscalls, you can predict which of these will set the <code class="inline"><span class="i">$!</span></code> (<code class="inline"><span class="i">$ERRNO</span></code> ) variable on failure. Unfortunately, beginning programmers often confusingly employ the term “system call” to mean what happens when you call the Perl <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/system">system</a></code> function, which actually involves many syscalls. To avoid any confusion, we nearly always say “syscall” for something you could call indirectly via Perl’s <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/syscall">syscall</a></code> function, and never for something you would call with Perl’s <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/system">system</a></code> function.</p> </li> </ul> <h3 id="T">T</h3> <ul> <li id="taint-checks">
<b>taint checks</b> <p>The special bookkeeping Perl does to track the flow of external data through your program and disallow their use in system commands.</p> </li> <li id="tainted">
<b>tainted</b> <p>Said of data derived from the grubby hands of a user, and thus unsafe for a secure program to rely on. Perl does taint checks if you run a <b>setuid</b> (or <b>setgid</b>) program, or if you use the <code class="inline"><span class="q">–T</span></code> switch.</p> </li> <li id="taint-mode">
<b>taint mode</b> <p>Running under the <code class="inline"><span class="q">–T</span></code> switch, marking all external data as suspect and refusing to use it with system commands. See Camel chapter 20, “Security”.</p> </li> <li id="TCP">
<b>TCP</b> <p>Short for Transmission Control Protocol. A protocol wrapped around the Internet Protocol to make an unreliable packet transmission mechanism appear to the application program to be a reliable <b>stream</b> of bytes. (Usually.)</p> </li> <li id="term">
<b>term</b> <p>Short for a “terminal”—that is, a leaf node of a <b>syntax tree</b>. A thing that functions grammatically as an <b>operand</b> for the operators in an expression.</p> </li> <li id="terminator">
<b>terminator</b> <p>A <b>character</b> or <b>string</b> that marks the end of another string. The <code class="inline"><span class="i">$/</span></code> variable contains the string that terminates a <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/readline">readline</a></code> operation, which <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/chomp">chomp</a></code> deletes from the end. Not to be confused with <b>delimiters</b> or <b>separators</b>. The period at the end of this sentence is a terminator.</p> </li> <li id="ternary">
<b>ternary</b> <p>An <b>operator</b> taking three <b>operands</b>. Sometimes pronounced <b>trinary</b>.</p> </li> <li id="text">
<b>text</b> <p>A <b>string</b> or <b>file</b> containing primarily printable characters.</p> </li> <li id="thread">
<b>thread</b> <p>Like a forked process, but without <b>fork</b>’s inherent memory protection. A thread is lighter weight than a full process, in that a process could have multiple threads running around in it, all fighting over the same process’s memory space unless steps are taken to protect threads from one another.</p> </li> <li id="tie">
<b>tie</b> <p>The bond between a magical variable and its implementation class. See the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/tie">tie</a></code> function in Camel chapter 27, “Functions” and Camel chapter 14, “Tied Variables”.</p> </li> <li id="titlecase">
<b>titlecase</b> <p>The case used for capitals that are followed by lowercase characters instead of by more capitals. Sometimes called sentence case or headline case. English doesn’t use Unicode titlecase, but casing rules for English titles are more complicated than simply capitalizing each word’s first character.</p> </li> <li id="TMTOWTDI">
<b>TMTOWTDI</b> <p>There’s More Than One Way To Do It, the Perl Motto. The notion that there can be more than one valid path to solving a programming problem in context. (This doesn’t mean that more ways are always better or that all possible paths are equally desirable—just that there need not be One True Way.)</p> </li> <li id="token">
<b>token</b> <p>A morpheme in a programming language, the smallest unit of text with semantic significance.</p> </li> <li id="tokener">
<b>tokener</b> <p>A module that breaks a program text into a sequence of <b>tokens</b> for later analysis by a parser.</p> </li> <li id="tokenizing">
<b>tokenizing</b> <p>Splitting up a program text into <b>tokens</b>. Also known as “lexing”, in which case you get “lexemes” instead of tokens.</p> </li> <li id="toolbox-approach">
<b>toolbox approach</b> <p>The notion that, with a complete set of simple tools that work well together, you can build almost anything you want. Which is fine if you’re assembling a tricycle, but if you’re building a defranishizing comboflux regurgalator, you really want your own machine shop in which to build special tools. Perl is sort of a machine shop.</p> </li> <li id="topic">
<b>topic</b> <p>The thing you’re working on. Structures like <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/while">while(&lt;&gt;)</a></code>, <code class="inline">for</code> , <code class="inline">foreach</code> , and <code class="inline">given</code> set the topic for you by assigning to <code class="inline"><span class="i">$_</span></code> , the default (<i>topic</i>) variable.</p> </li> <li id="transliterate">
<b>transliterate</b> <p>To turn one string representation into another by mapping each character of the source string to its corresponding character in the result string. Not to be confused with translation: for example, Greek <i>πολύχρωμος</i> transliterates into <i>polychromos</i> but translates into <i>many-colored</i>. See the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/tr">tr///</a></code> operator in Camel chapter 5, “Pattern Matching”.</p> </li> <li id="trigger">
<b>trigger</b> <p>An event that causes a <b>handler</b> to be run.</p> </li> <li id="trinary">
<b>trinary</b> <p>Not a stellar system with three stars, but an <b>operator</b> taking three <b>operands</b>. Sometimes pronounced <b>ternary</b>.</p> </li> <li id="troff">
<b>troff</b> <p>A venerable typesetting language from which Perl derives the name of its <code class="inline"><span class="i">$%</span></code> variable and which is secretly used in the production of Camel books.</p> </li> <li id="true">
<b>true</b> <p>Any scalar value that doesn’t evaluate to 0 or <code class="inline"><span class="q">""</span></code> .</p> </li> <li id="truncating">
<b>truncating</b> <p>Emptying a file of existing contents, either automatically when opening a file for writing or explicitly via the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/truncate">truncate</a></code> function.</p> </li> <li id="type">
<b>type</b> <p>See <b>data type</b> and <b>class</b>.</p> </li> <li id="type-casting">
<b>type casting</b> <p>Converting data from one type to another. C permits this. Perl does not need it. Nor want it.</p> </li> <li id="typedef">
<b>typedef</b> <p>A type definition in the C and C++ languages.</p> </li> <li id="typed-lexical">
<b>typed lexical</b> <p>A <b>lexical variable</b> lexical&gt;that is declared with a <b>class</b> type: <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/my">my</a> <span class="w">Pony</span> <span class="i">$bill</span></code> .</p> </li> <li id="typeglob">
<b>typeglob</b> <p>Use of a single identifier, prefixed with <code class="inline"><span class="i">*</span></code> . For example, <code class="inline"><span class="i">*name</span></code> stands for any or all of <code class="inline"><span class="i">$name</span></code> , <code class="inline"><span class="i">@name</span></code> , <code class="inline"><span class="i">%name</span></code> , <code class="inline"><span class="i">&amp;name</span></code> , or just <code class="inline"><span class="w">name</span></code> . How you use it determines whether it is interpreted as all or only one of them. See “Typeglobs and Filehandles” in Camel chapter 2, “Bits and Pieces”.</p> </li> <li id="typemap">
<b>typemap</b> <p>A description of how C types may be transformed to and from Perl types within an <b>extension</b> module written in <b>XS</b>.</p> </li> </ul> <h3 id="U">U</h3> <ul> <li id="UDP">
<b>UDP</b> <p>User Datagram Protocol, the typical way to send <b>datagrams</b> over the Internet.</p> </li> <li id="UID">
<b>UID</b> <p>A user ID. Often used in the context of <b>file</b> or <b>process</b> ownership.</p> </li> <li id="umask">
<b>umask</b> <p>A mask of those <b>permission bits</b> that should be forced off when creating files or directories, in order to establish a policy of whom you’ll ordinarily deny access to. See the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/umask">umask</a></code> function.</p> </li> <li id="unary-operator">
<b>unary operator</b> <p>An operator with only one <b>operand</b>, like <code class="inline">!</code> or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/chdir">chdir</a></code>. Unary operators are usually prefix operators; that is, they precede their operand. The <code class="inline">++</code> and <code class="inline"><span class="q">––</span></code> operators can be either prefix or postfix. (Their position <i>does</i> change their meanings.)</p> </li> <li id="Unicode">
<b>Unicode</b> <p>A character set comprising all the major character sets of the world, more or less. See <a href="http://www.unicode.org">http://www.unicode.org</a>.</p> </li> <li id="Unix">
<b>Unix</b> <p>A very large and constantly evolving language with several alternative and largely incompatible syntaxes, in which anyone can define anything any way they choose, and usually do. Speakers of this language think it’s easy to learn because it’s so easily twisted to one’s own ends, but dialectical differences make tribal intercommunication nearly impossible, and travelers are often reduced to a pidgin-like subset of the language. To be universally understood, a Unix shell programmer must spend years of study in the art. Many have abandoned this discipline and now communicate via an Esperanto-like language called Perl.</p> <p>In ancient times, Unix was also used to refer to some code that a couple of people at Bell Labs wrote to make use of a PDP-7 computer that wasn’t doing much of anything else at the time.</p> </li> <li id="uppercase">
<b>uppercase</b> <p>In Unicode, not just characters with the General Category of Uppercase Letter, but any character with the Uppercase property, including some Letter Numbers and Symbols. Not to be confused with <b>titlecase</b>.</p> </li> </ul> <h3 id="V">V</h3> <ul> <li id="value">
<b>value</b> <p>An actual piece of data, in contrast to all the variables, references, keys, indices, operators, and whatnot that you need to access the value.</p> </li> <li id="variable">
<b>variable</b> <p>A named storage location that can hold any of various kinds of <b>value</b>, as your program sees fit.</p> </li> <li id="variable-interpolation">
<b>variable interpolation</b> <p>The <b>interpolation</b> of a scalar or array variable into a string.</p> </li> <li id="variadic">
<b>variadic</b> <p>Said of a <b>function</b> that happily receives an indeterminate number of <b>actual arguments</b>.</p> </li> <li id="vector">
<b>vector</b> <p>Mathematical jargon for a list of <b>scalar values</b>.</p> </li> <li id="virtual">
<b>virtual</b> <p>Providing the appearance of something without the reality, as in: virtual memory is not real memory. (See also <b>memory</b>.) The opposite of “virtual” is “transparent”, which means providing the reality of something without the appearance, as in: Perl handles the variable-length UTF‑8 character encoding transparently.</p> </li> <li id="void-context">
<b>void context</b> <p>A form of <b>scalar context</b> in which an <b>expression</b> is not expected to return any <b>value</b> at all and is evaluated for its <b>side effects</b> alone.</p> </li> <li id="v-string">
<b>v-string</b> <p>A “version” or “vector” <b>string</b> specified with a <code class="inline"><span class="w">v</span></code> followed by a series of decimal integers in dot notation, for instance, <code class="inline"><span class="v">v1.20.300.4000</span></code> . Each number turns into a <b>character</b> with the specified ordinal value. (The <code class="inline"><span class="w">v</span></code> is optional when there are at least three integers.)</p> </li> </ul> <h3 id="W">W</h3> <ul> <li id="warning">
<b>warning</b> <p>A message printed to the <code class="inline"><span class="w">STDERR</span></code> stream to the effect that something might be wrong but isn’t worth blowing up over. See <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/warn">warn</a></code> in Camel chapter 27, “Functions” and the <code class="inline"><span class="w">warnings</span></code> pragma in Camel chapter 28, “Pragmantic Modules”.</p> </li> <li id="watch-expression">
<b>watch expression</b> <p>An expression which, when its value changes, causes a breakpoint in the Perl debugger.</p> </li> <li id="weak-reference">
<b>weak reference</b> <p>A reference that doesn’t get counted normally. When all the normal references to data disappear, the data disappears. These are useful for circular references that would never disappear otherwise.</p> </li> <li id="whitespace">
<b>whitespace</b> <p>A <b>character</b> that moves your cursor but doesn’t otherwise put anything on your screen. Typically refers to any of: space, tab, line feed, carriage return, or form feed. In Unicode, matches many other characters that Unicode considers whitespace, including the ɴ-ʙʀ .</p> </li> <li id="word">
<b>word</b> <p>In normal “computerese”, the piece of data of the size most efficiently handled by your computer, typically 32 bits or so, give or take a few powers of 2. In Perl culture, it more often refers to an alphanumeric <b>identifier</b> (including underscores), or to a string of nonwhitespace <b>characters</b> bounded by whitespace or string boundaries.</p> </li> <li id="working-directory">
<b>working directory</b> <p>Your current <b>directory</b>, from which relative pathnames are interpreted by the <b>operating system</b>. The operating system knows your current directory because you told it with a <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/chdir">chdir</a></code>, or because you started out in the place where your parent <b>process</b> was when you were born.</p> </li> <li id="wrapper">
<b>wrapper</b> <p>A program or subroutine that runs some other program or subroutine for you, modifying some of its input or output to better suit your purposes.</p> </li> <li id="WYSIWYG">
<b>WYSIWYG</b> <p>What You See Is What You Get. Usually used when something that appears on the screen matches how it will eventually look, like Perl’s <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/format">format</a></code> declarations. Also used to mean the opposite of magic because everything works exactly as it appears, as in the three- argument form of <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/open">open</a></code>.</p> </li> </ul> <h3 id="X">X</h3> <ul> <li id="XS">
<b>XS</b> <p>An extraordinarily exported, expeditiously excellent, expressly eXternal Subroutine, executed in existing C or C++ or in an exciting extension language called (exasperatingly) XS.</p> </li> <li id="XSUB">
<b>XSUB</b> <p>An external <b>subroutine</b> defined in <b>XS</b>.</p> </li> </ul> <h3 id="Y">Y</h3> <ul> <li id="yacc">
