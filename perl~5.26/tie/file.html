</pre>
<h2 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h2> <p><code class="inline"><span class="w">Tie::File</span></code> represents a regular text file as a Perl array. Each element in the array corresponds to a record in the file. The first line of the file is element 0 of the array; the second line is element 1, and so on.</p> <p>The file is <i>not</i> loaded into memory, so this will work even for gigantic files.</p> <p>Changes to the array are reflected in the file immediately.</p> <p>Lazy people and beginners may now stop reading the manual.</p> <h3 id="recsep">
<code class="inline"><span class="w">recsep</span></code> </h3> <p>What is a 'record'? By default, the meaning is the same as for the <code class="inline"><span class="q">&lt;...&gt;</span></code> operator: It's a string terminated by <code class="inline"><span class="i">$/</span></code> , which is probably <code class="inline"><span class="q">"\n"</span></code> . (Minor exception: on DOS and Win32 systems, a 'record' is a string terminated by <code class="inline"><span class="q">"\r\n"</span></code> .) You may change the definition of "record" by supplying the <code class="inline"><span class="w">recsep</span></code> option in the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="../functions/tie">tie</a></code> call:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">tie @array, 'Tie::File', $file, recsep =&gt; 'es';
</pre>
<p>This says that records are delimited by the string <code class="inline"><span class="w">es</span></code> . If the file contained the following data:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">Curse these pesky flies!\n
</pre>
<p>then the <code class="inline"><span class="i">@array</span></code> would appear to have four elements:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">"Curse th"
"e p"
"ky fli"
"!\n"
</pre>
<p>An undefined value is not permitted as a record separator. Perl's special "paragraph mode" semantics (Ã  la <code class="inline"><span class="i">$/</span> = <span class="q">""</span></code> ) are not emulated.</p> <p>Records read from the tied array do not have the record separator string on the end; this is to allow</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">$array[17] .= "extra";
</pre>
<p>to work as expected.</p> <p>(See <a href="#autochomp">autochomp</a>, below.) Records stored into the array will have the record separator string appended before they are written to the file, if they don't have one already. For example, if the record separator string is <code class="inline"><span class="q">"\n"</span></code> , then the following two lines do exactly the same thing:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">$array[17] = "Cherry pie";
$array[17] = "Cherry pie\n";
</pre>
<p>The result is that the contents of line 17 of the file will be replaced with "Cherry pie"; a newline character will separate line 17 from line 18. This means that this code will do nothing:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">chomp $array[17];
</pre>
<p>Because the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="../functions/chomp">chomp</a></code>ed value will have the separator reattached when it is written back to the file. There is no way to create a file whose trailing record separator string is missing.</p> <p>Inserting records that <i>contain</i> the record separator string is not supported by this module. It will probably produce a reasonable result, but what this result will be may change in a future version. Use 'splice' to insert records or to replace one record with several.</p> <h3 id="autochomp">
<code class="inline"><span class="w">autochomp</span></code> </h3> <p>Normally, array elements have the record separator removed, so that if the file contains the text</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">Gold
Frankincense
Myrrh
</pre>
<p>the tied array will appear to contain <code class="inline"><span class="s">(</span><span class="q">"Gold"</span><span class="cm">,</span> <span class="q">"Frankincense"</span><span class="cm">,</span>
<span class="q">"Myrrh"</span><span class="s">)</span></code> . If you set <code class="inline"><span class="w">autochomp</span></code> to a false value, the record separator will not be removed. If the file above was tied with</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">tie @gifts, "Tie::File", $gifts, autochomp =&gt; 0;
</pre>
<p>then the array <code class="inline"><span class="i">@gifts</span></code> would appear to contain <code class="inline"><span class="s">(</span><span class="q">"Gold\n"</span><span class="cm">,</span>
<span class="q">"Frankincense\n"</span><span class="cm">,</span> <span class="q">"Myrrh\n"</span><span class="s">)</span></code> , or (on Win32 systems) <code class="inline"><span class="s">(</span><span class="q">"Gold\r\n"</span><span class="cm">,</span>
<span class="q">"Frankincense\r\n"</span><span class="cm">,</span> <span class="q">"Myrrh\r\n"</span><span class="s">)</span></code> .</p> <h3 id="mode">
<code class="inline"><span class="w">mode</span></code> </h3> <p>Normally, the specified file will be opened for read and write access, and will be created if it does not exist. (That is, the flags <code class="inline"><span class="w">O_RDWR</span> | <span class="w">O_CREAT</span></code> are supplied in the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="../functions/open">open</a></code> call.) If you want to change this, you may supply alternative flags in the <code class="inline"><span class="w">mode</span></code> option. See <a href="../fcntl">Fcntl</a> for a listing of available flags. For example:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl"># open the file if it exists, but fail if it does not exist
use Fcntl 'O_RDWR';
tie @array, 'Tie::File', $file, mode =&gt; O_RDWR;

# create the file if it does not exist
use Fcntl 'O_RDWR', 'O_CREAT';
tie @array, 'Tie::File', $file, mode =&gt; O_RDWR | O_CREAT;

# open an existing file in read-only mode
use Fcntl 'O_RDONLY';
tie @array, 'Tie::File', $file, mode =&gt; O_RDONLY;
</pre>
<p>Opening the data file in write-only or append mode is not supported.</p> <h3 id="memory">
<code class="inline"><span class="w">memory</span></code> </h3> <p>This is an upper limit on the amount of memory that <code class="inline"><span class="w">Tie::File</span></code> will consume at any time while managing the file. This is used for two things: managing the <i>read cache</i> and managing the <i>deferred write buffer</i>.</p> <p>Records read in from the file are cached, to avoid having to re-read them repeatedly. If you read the same record twice, the first time it will be stored in memory, and the second time it will be fetched from the <i>read cache</i>. The amount of data in the read cache will not exceed the value you specified for <code class="inline"><span class="w">memory</span></code> . If <code class="inline"><span class="w">Tie::File</span></code> wants to cache a new record, but the read cache is full, it will make room by expiring the least-recently visited records from the read cache.</p> <p>The default memory limit is 2Mib. You can adjust the maximum read cache size by supplying the <code class="inline"><span class="w">memory</span></code> option. The argument is the desired cache size, in bytes.</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl"># I have a lot of memory, so use a large cache to speed up access
tie @array, 'Tie::File', $file, memory =&gt; 20_000_000;
</pre>
<p>Setting the memory limit to 0 will inhibit caching; records will be fetched from disk every time you examine them.</p> <p>The <code class="inline"><span class="w">memory</span></code> value is not an absolute or exact limit on the memory used. <code class="inline"><span class="w">Tie::File</span></code> objects contains some structures besides the read cache and the deferred write buffer, whose sizes are not charged against <code class="inline"><span class="w">memory</span></code> .</p> <p>The cache itself consumes about 310 bytes per cached record, so if your file has many short records, you may want to decrease the cache memory limit, or else the cache overhead may exceed the size of the cached data.</p> <h3 id="dw_size">
<code class="inline"><span class="w">dw_size</span></code> </h3> <p>(This is an advanced feature. Skip this section on first reading.)</p> <p>If you use deferred writing (See <a href="#Deferred-Writing">Deferred Writing</a>, below) then data you write into the array will not be written directly to the file; instead, it will be saved in the <i>deferred write buffer</i> to be written out later. Data in the deferred write buffer is also charged against the memory limit you set with the <code class="inline"><span class="w">memory</span></code> option.</p> <p>You may set the <code class="inline"><span class="w">dw_size</span></code> option to limit the amount of data that can be saved in the deferred write buffer. This limit may not exceed the total memory limit. For example, if you set <code class="inline"><span class="w">dw_size</span></code> to 1000 and <code class="inline"><span class="w">memory</span></code> to 2500, that means that no more than 1000 bytes of deferred writes will be saved up. The space available for the read cache will vary, but it will always be at least 1500 bytes (if the deferred write buffer is full) and it could grow as large as 2500 bytes (if the deferred write buffer is empty.)</p> <p>If you don't specify a <code class="inline"><span class="w">dw_size</span></code> , it defaults to the entire memory limit.</p> <h3 id="Option-Format">Option Format</h3> <p><code class="inline">-<span class="w">mode</span></code> is a synonym for <code class="inline"><span class="w">mode</span></code> . <code class="inline">-<span class="w">recsep</span></code> is a synonym for <code class="inline"><span class="w">recsep</span></code> . <code class="inline">-<span class="w">memory</span></code> is a synonym for <code class="inline"><span class="w">memory</span></code> . You get the idea.</p> <h2 id="Public-Methods">Public Methods</h2> <p>The <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="../functions/tie">tie</a></code> call returns an object, say <code class="inline"><span class="i">$o</span></code> . You may call</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">$rec = $o-&gt;FETCH($n);
$o-&gt;STORE($n, $rec);
</pre>
<p>to fetch or store the record at line <code class="inline"><span class="i">$n</span></code> , respectively; similarly the other tied array methods. (See <a href="../perltie">perltie</a> for details.) You may also call the following methods on this object:</p> <h3 id="flock"><code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="../functions/flock">flock</a></code></h3> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">$o-&gt;flock(MODE)
</pre>
<p>will lock the tied file. <code class="inline"><span class="w">MODE</span></code> has the same meaning as the second argument to the Perl built-in <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="../functions/flock">flock</a></code> function; for example <code class="inline"><span class="w">LOCK_SH</span></code> or <code class="inline"><span class="w">LOCK_EX</span> | <span class="w">LOCK_NB</span></code> . (These constants are provided by the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="../functions/use">use</a> <span class="w">Fcntl</span> <span class="q">':flock'</span></code> declaration.)</p> <p><code class="inline"><span class="w">MODE</span></code> is optional; the default is <code class="inline"><span class="w">LOCK_EX</span></code> .</p> <p><code class="inline"><span class="w">Tie::File</span></code> maintains an internal table of the byte offset of each record it has seen in the file.</p> <p>When you use <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="../functions/flock">flock</a></code> to lock the file, <code class="inline"><span class="w">Tie::File</span></code> assumes that the read cache is no longer trustworthy, because another process might have modified the file since the last time it was read. Therefore, a successful call to <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="../functions/flock">flock</a></code> discards the contents of the read cache and the internal record offset table.</p> <p><code class="inline"><span class="w">Tie::File</span></code> promises that the following sequence of operations will be safe:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">my $o = tie @array, "Tie::File", $filename;
$o-&gt;flock;
</pre>
<p>In particular, <code class="inline"><span class="w">Tie::File</span></code> will <i>not</i> read or write the file during the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="../functions/tie">tie</a></code> call. (Exception: Using <code class="inline"><span class="w">mode</span> <span class="cm">=&gt;</span> <span class="w">O_TRUNC</span></code> will, of course, erase the file during the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="../functions/tie">tie</a></code> call. If you want to do this safely, then open the file without <code class="inline"><span class="w">O_TRUNC</span></code> , lock the file, and use <code class="inline"><span class="i">@array</span> = <span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code> .)</p> <p>The best way to unlock a file is to discard the object and untie the array. It is probably unsafe to unlock the file without also untying it, because if you do, changes may remain unwritten inside the object. That is why there is no shortcut for unlocking. If you really want to unlock the file prematurely, you know what to do; if you don't know what to do, then don't do it.</p> <p>All the usual warnings about file locking apply here. In particular, note that file locking in Perl is <b>advisory</b>, which means that holding a lock will not prevent anyone else from reading, writing, or erasing the file; it only prevents them from getting another lock at the same time. Locks are analogous to green traffic lights: If you have a green light, that does not prevent the idiot coming the other way from plowing into you sideways; it merely guarantees to you that the idiot does not also have a green light at the same time.</p> <h3 id="autochomp">
<code class="inline"><span class="w">autochomp</span></code> </h3> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">my $old_value = $o-&gt;autochomp(0);    # disable autochomp option
my $old_value = $o-&gt;autochomp(1);    #  enable autochomp option

my $ac = $o-&gt;autochomp();   # recover current value
</pre>
<p>See <a href="#autochomp">autochomp</a>, above.</p> <h3 id="defer%2c-flush%2c-discard%2c-and-autodefer">
<code class="inline"><span class="w">defer</span></code> , <code class="inline"><span class="w">flush</span></code> , <code class="inline"><span class="w">discard</span></code> , and <code class="inline"><span class="w">autodefer</span></code> </h3> <p>See <a href="#Deferred-Writing">Deferred Writing</a>, below.</p> <h3 id="offset">
<code class="inline"><span class="w">offset</span></code> </h3> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">$off = $o-&gt;offset($n);
</pre>
<p>This method returns the byte offset of the start of the <code class="inline"><span class="i">$n</span></code> th record in the file. If there is no such record, it returns an undefined value.</p> <h2 id="Tying-to-an-already-opened-filehandle">Tying to an already-opened filehandle</h2> <p>If <code class="inline"><span class="i">$fh</span></code> is a filehandle, such as is returned by <code class="inline"><span class="w">IO::File</span></code> or one of the other <code class="inline"><span class="w">IO</span></code> modules, you may use:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">tie @array, 'Tie::File', $fh, ...;
</pre>
<p>Similarly if you opened that handle <code class="inline"><span class="w">FH</span></code> with regular <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="../functions/open">open</a></code> or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="../functions/sysopen">sysopen</a></code>, you may use:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">tie @array, 'Tie::File', \*FH, ...;
</pre>
<p>Handles that were opened write-only won't work. Handles that were opened read-only will work as long as you don't try to modify the array. Handles must be attached to seekable sources of data---that means no pipes or sockets. If <code class="inline"><span class="w">Tie::File</span></code> can detect that you supplied a non-seekable handle, the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="../functions/tie">tie</a></code> call will throw an exception. (On Unix systems, it can detect this.)</p> <p>Note that Tie::File will only close any filehandles that it opened internally. If you passed it a filehandle as above, you "own" the filehandle, and are responsible for closing it after you have untied the @array.</p> <h2 id="Deferred-Writing">Deferred Writing</h2> <p>(This is an advanced feature. Skip this section on first reading.)</p> <p>Normally, modifying a <code class="inline"><span class="w">Tie::File</span></code> array writes to the underlying file immediately. Every assignment like <code class="inline"><span class="i">$a</span>[<span class="n">3</span>] = ...</code> rewrites as much of the file as is necessary; typically, everything from line 3 through the end will need to be rewritten. This is the simplest and most transparent behavior. Performance even for large files is reasonably good.</p> <p>However, under some circumstances, this behavior may be excessively slow. For example, suppose you have a million-record file, and you want to do:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">for (@FILE) {
  $_ = "&gt; $_";
}
</pre>
<p>The first time through the loop, you will rewrite the entire file, from line 0 through the end. The second time through the loop, you will rewrite the entire file from line 1 through the end. The third time through the loop, you will rewrite the entire file from line 2 to the end. And so on.</p> <p>If the performance in such cases is unacceptable, you may defer the actual writing, and then have it done all at once. The following loop will perform much better for large files:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">(tied @a)-&gt;defer;
for (@a) {
  $_ = "&gt; $_";
}
(tied @a)-&gt;flush;
</pre>
<p>If <code class="inline"><span class="w">Tie::File</span></code> 's memory limit is large enough, all the writing will done in memory. Then, when you call <code class="inline"><span class="i">-&gt;flush</span></code> , the entire file will be rewritten in a single pass.</p> <p>(Actually, the preceding discussion is something of a fib. You don't need to enable deferred writing to get good performance for this common case, because <code class="inline"><span class="w">Tie::File</span></code> will do it for you automatically unless you specifically tell it not to. See <a href="#Autodeferring">Autodeferring</a>, below.)</p> <p>Calling <code class="inline"><span class="i">-&gt;flush</span></code> returns the array to immediate-write mode. If you wish to discard the deferred writes, you may call <code class="inline"><span class="i">-&gt;discard</span></code> instead of <code class="inline"><span class="i">-&gt;flush</span></code> . Note that in some cases, some of the data will have been written already, and it will be too late for <code class="inline"><span class="i">-&gt;discard</span></code> to discard all the changes. Support for <code class="inline"><span class="i">-&gt;discard</span></code> may be withdrawn in a future version of <code class="inline"><span class="w">Tie::File</span></code> .</p> <p>Deferred writes are cached in memory up to the limit specified by the <code class="inline"><span class="w">dw_size</span></code> option (see above). If the deferred-write buffer is full and you try to write still more deferred data, the buffer will be flushed. All buffered data will be written immediately, the buffer will be emptied, and the now-empty space will be used for future deferred writes.</p> <p>If the deferred-write buffer isn't yet full, but the total size of the buffer and the read cache would exceed the <code class="inline"><span class="w">memory</span></code> limit, the oldest records will be expired from the read cache until the total size is under the limit.</p> <p><code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="../functions/push">push</a></code>, <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="../functions/pop">pop</a></code>, <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="../functions/shift">shift</a></code>, <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="../functions/unshift">unshift</a></code>, and <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="../functions/splice">splice</a></code> cannot be deferred. When you perform one of these operations, any deferred data is written to the file and the operation is performed immediately. This may change in a future version.</p> <p>If you resize the array with deferred writing enabled, the file will be resized immediately, but deferred records will not be written. This has a surprising consequence: <code class="inline"><span class="i">@a</span> = <span class="s">(</span>...<span class="s">)</span></code> erases the file immediately, but the writing of the actual data is deferred. This might be a bug. If it is a bug, it will be fixed in a future version.</p> <h3 id="Autodeferring">Autodeferring</h3> <p><code class="inline"><span class="w">Tie::File</span></code> tries to guess when deferred writing might be helpful, and to turn it on and off automatically.</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">for (@a) {
  $_ = "&gt; $_";
}
</pre>
<p>In this example, only the first two assignments will be done immediately; after this, all the changes to the file will be deferred up to the user-specified memory limit.</p> <p>You should usually be able to ignore this and just use the module without thinking about deferring. However, special applications may require fine control over which writes are deferred, or may require that all writes be immediate. To disable the autodeferment feature, use</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">(tied @o)-&gt;autodefer(0);
</pre>
<p>or</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">tie @array, 'Tie::File', $file, autodefer =&gt; 0;
</pre>
<p>Similarly, <code class="inline"><span class="i">-&gt;autodefer</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="n">1</span><span class="s">)</span></code> re-enables autodeferment, and <code class="inline"><span class="i">-&gt;autodefer</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code> recovers the current value of the autodefer setting.</p> <h2 id="CONCURRENT-ACCESS-TO-FILES">CONCURRENT ACCESS TO FILES</h2> <p>Caching and deferred writing are inappropriate if you want the same file to be accessed simultaneously from more than one process. Other optimizations performed internally by this module are also incompatible with concurrent access. A future version of this module will support a <code class="inline"><span class="w">concurrent</span> <span class="cm">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">1</span></code> option that enables safe concurrent access.</p> <p>Previous versions of this documentation suggested using <code class="inline"><span class="w">memory</span>
<span class="cm">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">0</span></code> for safe concurrent access. This was mistaken. Tie::File will not support safe concurrent access before version 0.96.</p> <h2 id="CAVEATS">CAVEATS</h2> <p>(That's Latin for 'warnings'.)</p> <ul> <li> <p>Reasonable effort was made to make this module efficient. Nevertheless, changing the size of a record in the middle of a large file will always be fairly slow, because everything after the new record must be moved.</p> </li> <li> <p>The behavior of tied arrays is not precisely the same as for regular arrays. For example:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl"># This DOES print "How unusual!"
undef $a[10];  print "How unusual!\n" if defined $a[10];
</pre>
<p><code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="../functions/undef">undef</a></code>-ing a <code class="inline"><span class="w">Tie::File</span></code> array element just blanks out the corresponding record in the file. When you read it back again, you'll get the empty string, so the supposedly-<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="../functions/undef">undef</a></code>'ed value will be defined. Similarly, if you have <code class="inline"><span class="w">autochomp</span></code> disabled, then</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl"># This DOES print "How unusual!" if 'autochomp' is disabled
undef $a[10];
        print "How unusual!\n" if $a[10];
</pre>
<p>Because when <code class="inline"><span class="w">autochomp</span></code> is disabled, <code class="inline"><span class="i">$a</span>[<span class="n">10</span>]</code> will read back as <code class="inline"><span class="q">"\n"</span></code> (or whatever the record separator string is.)</p> <p>There are other minor differences, particularly regarding <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="../functions/exists">exists</a></code> and <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="../functions/delete">delete</a></code>, but in general, the correspondence is extremely close.</p> </li> <li> <p>I have supposed that since this module is concerned with file I/O, almost all normal use of it will be heavily I/O bound. This means that the time to maintain complicated data structures inside the module will be dominated by the time to actually perform the I/O. When there was an opportunity to spend CPU time to avoid doing I/O, I usually tried to take it.</p> </li> <li> <p>You might be tempted to think that deferred writing is like transactions, with <code class="inline"><span class="w">flush</span></code> as <code class="inline"><span class="w">commit</span></code> and <code class="inline"><span class="w">discard</span></code> as <code class="inline"><span class="w">rollback</span></code> , but it isn't, so don't.</p> </li> <li> <p>There is a large memory overhead for each record offset and for each cache entry: about 310 bytes per cached data record, and about 21 bytes per offset table entry.</p> <p>The per-record overhead will limit the maximum number of records you can access per file. Note that <i>accessing</i> the length of the array via <code class="inline"><span class="i">$x</span> = <a class="l_k" href="../functions/scalar">scalar</a> <span class="i">@tied_file</span></code> accesses <b>all</b> records and stores their offsets. The same for <code class="inline">foreach <span class="s">(</span><span class="i">@tied_file</span><span class="s">)</span></code> , even if you exit the loop early.</p> </li> </ul> <h2 id="SUBCLASSING">SUBCLASSING</h2> <p>This version promises absolutely nothing about the internals, which may change without notice. A future version of the module will have a well-defined and stable subclassing API.</p> <h2 id="WHAT-ABOUT-DB_File%3f">WHAT ABOUT <code class="inline"><span class="w">DB_File</span></code> ?</h2> <p>People sometimes point out that <a href="../db_file">DB_File</a> will do something similar, and ask why <code class="inline"><span class="w">Tie::File</span></code> module is necessary.</p> <p>There are a number of reasons that you might prefer <code class="inline"><span class="w">Tie::File</span></code> .

(Stuff I didn't think of yet.)</p> <p>Paragraph mode?</p> <p>Fixed-length mode. Leave-blanks mode.</p> <p>Maybe an autolocking mode?</p> <p>For many common uses of the module, the read cache is a liability. For example, a program that inserts a single record, or that scans the file once, will have a cache hit rate of zero. This suggests a major optimization: The cache should be initially disabled. Here's a hybrid approach: Initially, the cache is disabled, but the cache code maintains statistics about how high the hit rate would be *if* it were enabled. When it sees the hit rate get high enough, it enables itself. The STAT comments in this code are the beginning of an implementation of this.</p> <p>Record locking with fcntl()? Then the module might support an undo log and get real transactions. What a tour de force that would be.</p> <p>Keeping track of the highest cached record. This would allow reads-in-a-row to skip the cache lookup faster (if reading from 1..N with empty cache at start, the last cached value will be always N-1).</p> <p>More tests.</p>
