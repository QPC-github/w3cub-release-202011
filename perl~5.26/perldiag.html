</ul>
<h2 id="NAME">NAME</h2> <p>perldiag - various Perl diagnostics</p> <h2 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h2> <p>These messages are classified as follows (listed in increasing order of desperation):</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">(W) A warning (optional).
(D) A deprecation (enabled by default).
(S) A severe warning (enabled by default).
(F) A fatal error (trappable).
(P) An internal error you should never see (trappable).
(X) A very fatal error (nontrappable).
(A) An alien error message (not generated by Perl).
</pre>
<p>The majority of messages from the first three classifications above (W, D &amp; S) can be controlled using the <code class="inline"><span class="w">warnings</span></code> pragma.</p> <p>If a message can be controlled by the <code class="inline"><span class="w">warnings</span></code> pragma, its warning category is included with the classification letter in the description below. E.g. <code class="inline"><span class="s">(</span><span class="w">W</span> <span class="w">closed</span><span class="s">)</span></code> means a warning in the <code class="inline"><span class="w">closed</span></code> category.</p> <p>Optional warnings are enabled by using the <code class="inline"><span class="w">warnings</span></code> pragma or the <b>-w</b> and <b>-W</b> switches. Warnings may be captured by setting <code class="inline"><span class="i">$SIG</span>{<span class="w">__WARN__</span>}</code> to a reference to a routine that will be called on each warning instead of printing it. See <a href="perlvar">perlvar</a>.</p> <p>Severe warnings are always enabled, unless they are explicitly disabled with the <code class="inline"><span class="w">warnings</span></code> pragma or the <b>-X</b> switch.</p> <p>Trappable errors may be trapped using the eval operator. See <a href="functions/eval">eval</a>. In almost all cases, warnings may be selectively disabled or promoted to fatal errors using the <code class="inline"><span class="w">warnings</span></code> pragma. See <a href="warnings">warnings</a>.</p> <p>The messages are in alphabetical order, without regard to upper or lower-case. Some of these messages are generic. Spots that vary are denoted with a %s or other printf-style escape. These escapes are ignored by the alphabetical order, as are all characters other than letters. To look up your message, just ignore anything that is not a letter.</p> <ul> <li id="accept()-on-closed-socket-%25s">
<b>accept() on closed socket %s</b> <p>(W closed) You tried to do an accept on a closed socket. Did you forget to check the return value of your socket() call? See <a href="functions/accept">accept</a>.</p> </li> <li id="Aliasing-via-reference-is-experimental">
<b>Aliasing via reference is experimental</b> <p>(S experimental::refaliasing) This warning is emitted if you use a reference constructor on the left-hand side of an assignment to alias one variable to another. Simply suppress the warning if you want to use the feature, but know that in doing so you are taking the risk of using an experimental feature which may change or be removed in a future Perl version:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">no warnings "experimental::refaliasing";
use feature "refaliasing";
\$x = \$y;
</pre>
</li> <li id="Allocation-too-large%3a-%25x">
<b>Allocation too large: %x</b> <p>(X) You can't allocate more than 64K on an MS-DOS machine.</p> </li> <li id="'%25c'-allowed-only-after-types-%25s-in-%25s">
<b>'%c' allowed only after types %s in %s</b> <p>(F) The modifiers '!', '&lt;' and '&gt;' are allowed in pack() or unpack() only after certain types. See <a href="functions/pack">pack</a>.</p> </li> <li id="Ambiguous-call-resolved-as-CORE%3a%3a%25s()%2c-qualify-as-such-or-use-%26">
<b>Ambiguous call resolved as CORE::%s(), qualify as such or use &amp;</b> <p>(W ambiguous) A subroutine you have declared has the same name as a Perl keyword, and you have used the name without qualification for calling one or the other. Perl decided to call the builtin because the subroutine is not imported.</p> <p>To force interpretation as a subroutine call, either put an ampersand before the subroutine name, or qualify the name with its package. Alternatively, you can import the subroutine (or pretend that it's imported with the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use">use</a> <span class="w">subs</span></code> pragma).</p> <p>To silently interpret it as the Perl operator, use the <code class="inline"><span class="w">CORE::</span></code> prefix on the operator (e.g. <code class="inline"><span class="i">CORE::log</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="i">$x</span><span class="s">)</span></code> ) or declare the subroutine to be an object method (see <a href="perlsub#Subroutine-Attributes">Subroutine Attributes in perlsub</a> or <a href="attributes">attributes</a>).</p> </li> <li id="Ambiguous-range-in-transliteration-operator">
<b>Ambiguous range in transliteration operator</b> <p>(F) You wrote something like <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/tr">tr/a-z-0//</a></code> which doesn't mean anything at all. To include a <code class="inline">-</code> character in a transliteration, put it either first or last. (In the past, <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/tr">tr/a-z-0//</a></code> was synonymous with <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/tr">tr/a-y//</a></code>, which was probably not what you would have expected.)</p> </li> <li id="Ambiguous-use-of-%25s-resolved-as-%25s">
<b>Ambiguous use of %s resolved as %s</b> <p>(S ambiguous) You said something that may not be interpreted the way you thought. Normally it's pretty easy to disambiguate it by supplying a missing quote, operator, parenthesis pair or declaration.</p> </li> <li id="Ambiguous-use-of--%25s-resolved-as--%26%25s()">
<b>Ambiguous use of -%s resolved as -&amp;%s()</b> <p>(S ambiguous) You wrote something like <code class="inline">-<span class="w">foo</span></code> , which might be the string <code class="inline"><span class="q">"-foo"</span></code> , or a call to the function <code class="inline"><span class="w">foo</span></code> , negated. If you meant the string, just write <code class="inline"><span class="q">"-foo"</span></code> . If you meant the function call, write <code class="inline">-<span class="i">foo</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code> .</p> </li> <li id="Ambiguous-use-of-%25c-resolved-as-operator-%25c">
<b>Ambiguous use of %c resolved as operator %c</b> <p>(S ambiguous) <code class="inline"><span class="i">%</span></code> , <code class="inline"><span class="i">&amp;</span></code> , and <code class="inline"><span class="i">*</span></code> are both infix operators (modulus, bitwise and, and multiplication) <i>and</i> initial special characters (denoting hashes, subroutines and typeglobs), and you said something like <code class="inline"><span class="i">*foo</span> * <span class="w">foo</span></code> that might be interpreted as either of them. We assumed you meant the infix operator, but please try to make it more clear -- in the example given, you might write <code class="inline"><span class="i">*foo</span> * <span class="i">foo</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code> if you really meant to multiply a glob by the result of calling a function.</p> </li> <li id="Ambiguous-use-of-%25c%7b%25s%7d-resolved-to-%25c%25s">
<b>Ambiguous use of %c{%s} resolved to %c%s</b> <p>(W ambiguous) You wrote something like <code class="inline"><span class="i">@</span>{<span class="w">foo</span>}</code> , which might be asking for the variable <code class="inline"><span class="i">@foo</span></code> , or it might be calling a function named foo, and dereferencing it as an array reference. If you wanted the variable, you can just write <code class="inline"><span class="i">@foo</span></code> . If you wanted to call the function, write <code class="inline"><span class="i">@</span>{<span class="i">foo</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span>}</code> ... or you could just not have a variable and a function with the same name, and save yourself a lot of trouble.</p> </li> <li id="Ambiguous-use-of-%25c%7b%25s%5b...%5d%7d-resolved-to-%25c%25s%5b...%5d">
<b>Ambiguous use of %c{%s[...]} resolved to %c%s[...]</b> </li> <li id="Ambiguous-use-of-%25c%7b%25s%7b...%7d%7d-resolved-to-%25c%25s%7b...%7d">
<b>Ambiguous use of %c{%s{...}} resolved to %c%s{...}</b> <p>(W ambiguous) You wrote something like <code class="inline"><span class="i">$</span>{<span class="w">foo</span><span class="s">[</span><span class="n">2</span><span class="s">]</span>}</code> (where foo represents the name of a Perl keyword), which might be looking for element number 2 of the array named <code class="inline"><span class="i">@foo</span></code> , in which case please write <code class="inline"><span class="i">$foo</span>[<span class="n">2</span>]</code> , or you might have meant to pass an anonymous arrayref to the function named foo, and then do a scalar deref on the value it returns. If you meant that, write <code class="inline"><span class="i">$</span>{<span class="i">foo</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">[</span><span class="n">2</span><span class="s">]</span><span class="s">)</span>}</code> .</p> <p>In regular expressions, the <code class="inline"><span class="i">$</span>{<span class="w">foo</span><span class="s">[</span><span class="n">2</span><span class="s">]</span>}</code> syntax is sometimes necessary to disambiguate between array subscripts and character classes. <code class="inline"><span class="q">/$length[2345]/</span></code> , for instance, will be interpreted as <code class="inline"><span class="i">$length</span></code> followed by the character class <code class="inline"><span class="s">[</span><span class="n">2345</span><span class="s">]</span></code> . If an array subscript is what you want, you can avoid the warning by changing <code class="inline"><span class="q">/${length[2345]}/</span></code> to the unsightly <code class="inline"><span class="q">/${\$length[2345]}/</span></code> , by renaming your array to something that does not coincide with a built-in keyword, or by simply turning off warnings with <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/no">no</a> <span class="w">warnings</span> <span class="q">'ambiguous'</span><span class="sc">;</span></code> .</p> </li> <li id="'%7c'-and-'%3c'-may-not-both-be-specified-on-command-line">
<b>'|' and '&lt;' may not both be specified on command line</b> <p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS. Perl does its own command line redirection, and found that STDIN was a pipe, and that you also tried to redirect STDIN using '&lt;'. Only one STDIN stream to a customer, please.</p> </li> <li id="'%7c'-and-'%3e'-may-not-both-be-specified-on-command-line">
<b>'|' and '&gt;' may not both be specified on command line</b> <p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS. Perl does its own command line redirection, and thinks you tried to redirect stdout both to a file and into a pipe to another command. You need to choose one or the other, though nothing's stopping you from piping into a program or Perl script which 'splits' output into two streams, such as</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">open(OUT,"&gt;$ARGV[0]") or die "Can't write to $ARGV[0]: $!";

close OUT;
</pre>
</li> <li id="Applying-%25s-to-%25s-will-act-on-scalar(%25s)">
<b>Applying %s to %s will act on scalar(%s)</b> <p>(W misc) The pattern match (<code class="inline"><span class="q">//</span></code> ), substitution (<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/s">s///</a></code>), and transliteration (<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/tr">tr///</a></code>) operators work on scalar values. If you apply one of them to an array or a hash, it will convert the array or hash to a scalar value (the length of an array, or the population info of a hash) and then work on that scalar value. This is probably not what you meant to do. See <a href="functions/grep">grep</a> and <a href="functions/map">map</a> for alternatives.</p> </li> <li id="Arg-too-short-for-msgsnd">
<b>Arg too short for msgsnd</b> <p>(F) msgsnd() requires a string at least as long as sizeof(long).</p> </li> <li id="Argument-%22%25s%22-isn't-numeric%25s">
<b>Argument "%s" isn't numeric%s</b> <p>(W numeric) The indicated string was fed as an argument to an operator that expected a numeric value instead. If you're fortunate the message will identify which operator was so unfortunate.</p> <p>Note that for the <code class="inline"><span class="w">Inf</span></code> and <code class="inline"><span class="w">NaN</span></code> (infinity and not-a-number) the definition of "numeric" is somewhat unusual: the strings themselves (like "Inf") are considered numeric, and anything following them is considered non-numeric.</p> </li> <li id="Argument-list-not-closed-for-PerlIO-layer-%22%25s%22">
<b>Argument list not closed for PerlIO layer "%s"</b> <p>(W layer) When pushing a layer with arguments onto the Perl I/O system you forgot the ) that closes the argument list. (Layers take care of transforming data between external and internal representations.) Perl stopped parsing the layer list at this point and did not attempt to push this layer. If your program didn't explicitly request the failing operation, it may be the result of the value of the environment variable PERLIO.</p> </li> <li id="Argument-%22%25s%22-treated-as-0-in-increment-(%2b%2b)">
<b>Argument "%s" treated as 0 in increment (++)</b> <p>(W numeric) The indicated string was fed as an argument to the <code class="inline">++</code> operator which expects either a number or a string matching <code class="inline"><span class="q">/^[a-zA-Z]*[0-9]*\z/</span></code> . See <a href="perlop#Auto-increment-and-Auto-decrement">Auto-increment and Auto-decrement in perlop</a> for details.</p> </li> <li id="assertion-botched%3a-%25s">
<b>assertion botched: %s</b> <p>(X) The malloc package that comes with Perl had an internal failure.</p> </li> <li id="Assertion-%25s-failed%3a-file-%22%25s%22%2c-line-%25d">
<b>Assertion %s failed: file "%s", line %d</b> <p>(X) A general assertion failed. The file in question must be examined.</p> </li> <li id="Assigned-value-is-not-a-reference">
<b>Assigned value is not a reference</b> <p>(F) You tried to assign something that was not a reference to an lvalue reference (e.g., <code class="inline">\<span class="i">$x</span> = <span class="i">$y</span></code> ). If you meant to make $x an alias to $y, use <code class="inline">\<span class="i">$x</span> = \<span class="i">$y</span></code> .</p> </li> <li id="Assigned-value-is-not-%25s-reference">
<b>Assigned value is not %s reference</b> <p>(F) You tried to assign a reference to a reference constructor, but the two references were not of the same type. You cannot alias a scalar to an array, or an array to a hash; the two types must match.</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">\$x = \@y;  # error
\@x = \%y;  # error
 $y = [];
\$x = $y;   # error; did you mean \$y?
</pre>
</li> <li id="Assigning-non-zero-to-%24%5b-is-no-longer-possible">
<b>Assigning non-zero to $[ is no longer possible</b> <p>(F) When the "array_base" feature is disabled (e.g., under <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use">use</a> <span class="v">v5.16</span><span class="sc">;</span></code> ) the special variable <code class="inline"><span class="i">$[</span></code> , which is deprecated, is now a fixed zero value.</p> </li> <li id="Assignment-to-both-a-list-and-a-scalar">
<b>Assignment to both a list and a scalar</b> <p>(F) If you assign to a conditional operator, the 2nd and 3rd arguments must either both be scalars or both be lists. Otherwise Perl won't know which context to supply to the right side.</p> </li> <li id="%3c%3e-at-require-statement-should-be-quotes">
<b>&lt;&gt; at require-statement should be quotes</b> <p>(F) You wrote <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/require">require</a> <span class="q">&lt;file&gt;</span></code> when you should have written <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/require">require</a> <span class="q">'file'</span></code> .</p> </li> <li id="Attempt-to-access-disallowed-key-'%25s'-in-a-restricted-hash">
<b>Attempt to access disallowed key '%s' in a restricted hash</b> <p>(F) The failing code has attempted to get or set a key which is not in the current set of allowed keys of a restricted hash.</p> </li> <li id="Attempt-to-bless-into-a-freed-package">
<b>Attempt to bless into a freed package</b> <p>(F) You wrote <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/bless">bless</a> <span class="i">$foo</span></code> with one argument after somehow causing the current package to be freed. Perl cannot figure out what to do, so it throws up in hands in despair.</p> </li> <li id="Attempt-to-bless-into-a-reference">
<b>Attempt to bless into a reference</b> <p>(F) The CLASSNAME argument to the bless() operator is expected to be the name of the package to bless the resulting object into. You've supplied instead a reference to something: perhaps you wrote</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">bless $self, $proto;
</pre>
<p>when you intended</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">bless $self, ref($proto) || $proto;
</pre>
<p>If you actually want to bless into the stringified version of the reference supplied, you need to stringify it yourself, for example by:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">bless $self, "$proto";
</pre>
</li> <li id="Attempt-to-clear-deleted-array">
<b>Attempt to clear deleted array</b> <p>(S debugging) An array was assigned to when it was being freed. Freed values are not supposed to be visible to Perl code. This can also happen if XS code calls <code class="inline"><span class="w">av_clear</span></code> from a custom magic callback on the array.</p> </li> <li id="Attempt-to-delete-disallowed-key-'%25s'-from-a-restricted-hash">
<b>Attempt to delete disallowed key '%s' from a restricted hash</b> <p>(F) The failing code attempted to delete from a restricted hash a key which is not in its key set.</p> </li> <li id="Attempt-to-delete-readonly-key-'%25s'-from-a-restricted-hash">
<b>Attempt to delete readonly key '%s' from a restricted hash</b> <p>(F) The failing code attempted to delete a key whose value has been declared readonly from a restricted hash.</p> </li> <li id="Attempt-to-free-non-arena-SV%3a-0x%25x">
<b>Attempt to free non-arena SV: 0x%x</b> <p>(S internal) All SV objects are supposed to be allocated from arenas that will be garbage collected on exit. An SV was discovered to be outside any of those arenas.</p> </li> <li id="Attempt-to-free-nonexistent-shared-string-'%25s'%25s">
<b>Attempt to free nonexistent shared string '%s'%s</b> <p>(S internal) Perl maintains a reference-counted internal table of strings to optimize the storage and access of hash keys and other strings. This indicates someone tried to decrement the reference count of a string that can no longer be found in the table.</p> </li> <li id="Attempt-to-free-temp-prematurely%3a-SV-0x%25x">
<b>Attempt to free temp prematurely: SV 0x%x</b> <p>(S debugging) Mortalized values are supposed to be freed by the free_tmps() routine. This indicates that something else is freeing the SV before the free_tmps() routine gets a chance, which means that the free_tmps() routine will be freeing an unreferenced scalar when it does try to free it.</p> </li> <li id="Attempt-to-free-unreferenced-glob-pointers">
<b>Attempt to free unreferenced glob pointers</b> <p>(S internal) The reference counts got screwed up on symbol aliases.</p> </li> <li id="Attempt-to-free-unreferenced-scalar%3a-SV-0x%25x">
<b>Attempt to free unreferenced scalar: SV 0x%x</b> <p>(S internal) Perl went to decrement the reference count of a scalar to see if it would go to 0, and discovered that it had already gone to 0 earlier, and should have been freed, and in fact, probably was freed. This could indicate that SvREFCNT_dec() was called too many times, or that SvREFCNT_inc() was called too few times, or that the SV was mortalized when it shouldn't have been, or that memory has been corrupted.</p> </li> <li id="Attempt-to-pack-pointer-to-temporary-value">
<b>Attempt to pack pointer to temporary value</b> <p>(W pack) You tried to pass a temporary value (like the result of a function, or a computed expression) to the "p" pack() template. This means the result contains a pointer to a location that could become invalid anytime, even before the end of the current statement. Use literals or global values as arguments to the "p" pack() template to avoid this warning.</p> </li> <li id="Attempt-to-reload-%25s-aborted.">
<b>Attempt to reload %s aborted.</b> <p>(F) You tried to load a file with <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use">use</a></code> or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/require">require</a></code> that failed to compile once already. Perl will not try to compile this file again unless you delete its entry from %INC. See <a href="functions/require">require</a> and <a href="perlvar#%25INC">%INC in perlvar</a>.</p> </li> <li id="Attempt-to-set-length-of-freed-array">
<b>Attempt to set length of freed array</b> <p>(W misc) You tried to set the length of an array which has been freed. You can do this by storing a reference to the scalar representing the last index of an array and later assigning through that reference. For example</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">$r = do {my @a; \$#a};
$$r = 503
</pre>
</li> <li id="Attempt-to-use-reference-as-lvalue-in-substr">
<b>Attempt to use reference as lvalue in substr</b> <p>(W substr) You supplied a reference as the first argument to substr() used as an lvalue, which is pretty strange. Perhaps you forgot to dereference it first. See <a href="functions/substr">substr</a>.</p> </li> <li id="Attribute-%22locked%22-is-deprecated">

<b>Can't get filespec - stale stat buffer?</b> <p>(S) A warning peculiar to VMS. This arises because of the difference between access checks under VMS and under the Unix model Perl assumes. Under VMS, access checks are done by filename, rather than by bits in the stat buffer, so that ACLs and other protections can be taken into account. Unfortunately, Perl assumes that the stat buffer contains all the necessary information, and passes it, instead of the filespec, to the access-checking routine. It will try to retrieve the filespec using the device name and FID present in the stat buffer, but this works only if you haven't made a subsequent call to the CRTL stat() routine, because the device name is overwritten with each call. If this warning appears, the name lookup failed, and the access-checking routine gave up and returned FALSE, just to be conservative. (Note: The access-checking routine knows about the Perl <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/stat">stat</a></code> operator and file tests, so you shouldn't ever see this warning in response to a Perl command; it arises only if some internal code takes stat buffers lightly.)</p> </li> <li id="Can't-get-pipe-mailbox-device-name">

<b>Can't ignore signal CHLD, forcing to default</b> <p>(W signal) Perl has detected that it is being run with the SIGCHLD signal (sometimes known as SIGCLD) disabled. Since disabling this signal will interfere with proper determination of exit status of child processes, Perl has reset the signal to its default value.

<b>Can't load '%s' for module %s</b> <p>(F) The module you tried to load failed to load a dynamic extension. This may either mean that you upgraded your version of perl to one that is incompatible with your old dynamic extensions (which is known to happen between major versions of perl), or (more likely) that your dynamic extension was built against an older version of the library that is installed on your system. You may need to rebuild your old dynamic extensions.</p> </li> <li id="Can't-localize-lexical-variable-%25s">

Perl looks for the file in all the locations mentioned in @INC, unless the file name included the full path to the file. Perhaps you need to set the PERL5LIB or PERL5OPT environment variable to say where the extra library is, or maybe the script needs to add the library name to @INC.

<b>Delimiter for here document is too long</b> <p>(F) In a here document construct like <code class="inline">&lt;&lt;FOO</code>, the label <code class="inline"><span class="w">FOO</span></code> is too long for Perl to handle. You have to be seriously twisted to write code that triggers this error.</p> </li> <li id="Deprecated-use-of-my()-in-false-conditional">
<b>Deprecated use of my() in false conditional</b> <p>(D deprecated) You used a declaration similar to <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/my">my</a> <span class="i">$x</span> if <span class="n">0</span></code> . There has been a long-standing bug in Perl that causes a lexical variable not to be cleared at scope exit when its declaration includes a false conditional. Some people have exploited this bug to achieve a kind of static variable. Since we intend to fix this bug, we don't want people relying on this behavior. You can achieve a similar static effect by declaring the variable in a separate block outside the function, eg</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">sub f { my $x if 0; return $x++ }
</pre>
<p>becomes</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">{ my $x; sub f { return $x++ } }
</pre>
<p>Beginning with perl 5.10.0, you can also use <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/state">state</a></code> variables to have lexicals that are initialized only once (see <a href="feature">feature</a>):</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">sub f { state $x; return $x++ }

Unicode properties are only defined on Unicode code points, so the result of this match is undefined by Unicode, but Perl (starting in v5.20) treats non-Unicode code points as if they were typical unassigned Unicode ones, and matched this one accordingly. Whether a given property matches these code points or not is specified in <a href="perluniprops#Properties-accessible-through-%5cp%7b%7d-and-%5cP%7b%7d">Properties accessible through \p{} and \P{} in perluniprops</a>.</p> <p>This message is suppressed (unless it has been made fatal) if it is immaterial to the results of the match if the code point is Unicode or not. For example, the property <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">ASCII_Hex_Digit</span><span class="s">}</span></code> only can match the 22 characters <code class="inline"><span class="s">[</span><span class="n">0</span>-<span class="n">9</span><span class="w">A</span>-<span class="w">Fa</span>-f<span class="s">]</span></code> , so obviously all other code points, Unicode or not, won't match it. (And <code class="inline">\<span class="i">P</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">ASCII_Hex_Digit</span><span class="s">}</span></code> will match every code point except these 22.)</p> <p>Getting this message indicates that the outcome of the match arguably should have been the opposite of what actually happened. If you think that is the case, you may wish to make the <code class="inline"><span class="w">non_unicode</span></code> warnings category fatal; if you agree with Perl's decision, you may wish to turn off this category.</p> <p>See <a href="perlunicode#Beyond-Unicode-code-points">Beyond Unicode code points in perlunicode</a> for more information.</p> </li> <li id="%25s-matches-null-string-many-times-in-regex%3b-marked-by-%3c---HERE-in-m%2f%25s%2f">

When <code class="inline">\<span class="w">N</span></code> is not followed immediately by a left brace, Perl assumes the <code class="inline">[^\n]</code> meaning.

In all other case, where there is a <code class="inline">\N{</code> and a matching <code class="inline">}</code>, Perl assumes that a character name is desired.</p> <p>However, if there is no matching <code class="inline">}</code>, Perl doesn't know if it was mistakenly omitted, or if <code class="inline">[^\n]{</code> was desired, and raises this error.

<b>Subroutine "&amp;%s" is not available</b> <p>(W closure) During compilation, an inner named subroutine or eval is attempting to capture an outer lexical subroutine that is not currently available. This can happen for one of two reasons. First, the lexical subroutine may be declared in an outer anonymous subroutine that has not yet been created. (Remember that named subs are created at compile time, while anonymous subs are created at run-time.) For example,</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">sub { my sub a {...} sub f { \&amp;a } }
</pre>
<p>At the time that f is created, it can't capture the current "a" sub, since the anonymous subroutine hasn't been created yet. Conversely, the following won't give a warning since the anonymous subroutine has by now been created and is live:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">sub { my sub a {...} eval 'sub f { \&amp;a }' }-&gt;();
</pre>
<p>The second situation is caused by an eval accessing a lexical subroutine that has gone out of scope, for example,</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">    sub f {
my sub a {...}
sub { eval '\&amp;a' }
    }
    f()-&gt;();
</pre>
<p>Here, when the '\&amp;a' in the eval is being compiled, f() is not currently being executed, so its &amp;a is not available for capture.</p> </li> <li id="%22%25s%22-subroutine-%26%25s-masks-earlier-declaration-in-same-%25s">
<b>"%s" subroutine &amp;%s masks earlier declaration in same %s</b> <p>(W misc) A "my" or "state" subroutine has been redeclared in the current scope or statement, effectively eliminating all access to the previous instance. This is almost always a typographical error. Note that the earlier subroutine will still exist until the end of the scope or until all closure references to it are destroyed.</p> </li> <li id="Subroutine-%25s-redefined">
<b>Subroutine %s redefined</b> <p>(W redefine) You redefined a subroutine. To suppress this warning, say</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">    {

eval "sub name { ... }";
    }
</pre>
</li> <li id="Subroutine-%22%25s%22-will-not-stay-shared">
<b>Subroutine "%s" will not stay shared</b> <p>(W closure) An inner (nested) <i>named</i> subroutine is referencing a "my" subroutine defined in an outer named subroutine.</p> <p>When the inner subroutine is called, it will see the value of the outer subroutine's lexical subroutine as it was before and during the *first* call to the outer subroutine; in this case, after the first call to the outer subroutine is complete, the inner and outer subroutines will no longer share a common value for the lexical subroutine. In other words, it will no longer be shared. This will especially make a difference if the lexical subroutines accesses lexical variables declared in its surrounding scope.</p> <p>This problem can usually be solved by making the inner subroutine anonymous, using the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/sub">sub</a> <span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code> syntax. When inner anonymous subs that reference lexical subroutines in outer subroutines are created, they are automatically rebound to the current values of such lexical subs.</p> </li> <li id="Substitution-loop">

<b>Useless use of %s in void context</b> <p>(W void) You did something without a side effect in a context that does nothing with the return value, such as a statement that doesn't return a value from a block, or the left side of a scalar comma operator. Very often this points not to stupidity on your part, but a failure of Perl to parse your program the way you thought it would. For example, you'd get this if you mixed up your C precedence with Python precedence and said</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">$one, $two = 1, 2;

<p>when you meant to say</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">($one, $two) = (1, 2);

</pre>
<p>The square brackets explicitly turn a list value into a scalar value, while parentheses do not.

<b>Variable "%s" is not available</b> <p>(W closure) During compilation, an inner named subroutine or eval is attempting to capture an outer lexical that is not currently available. This can happen for one of two reasons. First, the outer lexical may be declared in an outer anonymous subroutine that has not yet been created. (Remember that named subs are created at compile time, while anonymous subs are created at run-time.) For example,</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">sub { my $a; sub f { $a } }
</pre>
<p>At the time that f is created, it can't capture the current value of $a, since the anonymous subroutine hasn't been created yet. Conversely, the following won't give a warning since the anonymous subroutine has by now been created and is live:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">sub { my $a; eval 'sub f { $a }' }-&gt;();
</pre>
<p>The second situation is caused by an eval accessing a variable that has gone out of scope, for example,</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">    sub f {
my $a;
sub { eval '$a' }
    }
    f()-&gt;();
</pre>
<p>Here, when the '$a' in the eval is being compiled, f() is not currently being executed, so its $a is not available for capture.</p> </li> <li id="Variable-%22%25s%22-is-not-imported%25s">
<b>Variable "%s" is not imported%s</b> <p>(S misc) With "use strict" in effect, you referred to a global variable that you apparently thought was imported from another module, because something else of the same name (usually a subroutine) is exported by that module.

See <a href="perlre#(%3f%3c%3dpattern)-%5cK">(?&lt;=pattern) \K in perlre</a>.</p> <p>There are non-obvious Unicode rules under <code class="inline">/i</code> that can match variably, but which you might not think could. For example, the substring <code class="inline"><span class="q">"ss"</span></code> can match the single character LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S. There are other sequences of ASCII characters that can match single ligature characters, such as LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FFI matching <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/qr">qr/ffi/i</a></code>. Starting in Perl v5.16, if you only care about ASCII matches, adding the <code class="inline"><span class="q">/aa</span></code> modifier to the regex will exclude all these non-obvious matches, thus getting rid of this message. You can also say <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use">use</a> <span class="w">re</span> <span class="q">qw(/aa)</span></code> to apply <code class="inline"><span class="q">/aa</span></code> to all regular expressions compiled within its scope.

This is not possible if it contains any of the codes @, /, U, u, w or a *-length. Redesign the template.</p> </li> <li id="write()-on-closed-filehandle-%25s">
<b>write() on closed filehandle %s</b> <p>(W closed) The filehandle you're writing to got itself closed sometime before now. Check your control flow.</p> </li> <li id="%25s-%22%5cx%25X%22-does-not-map-to-Unicode">
<b>%s "\x%X" does not map to Unicode</b> <p>(S utf8) When reading in different encodings, Perl tries to map everything into Unicode characters. The bytes you read in are not legal in this encoding. For example</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">utf8 "\xE4" does not map to Unicode
</pre>
<p>if you try to read in the a-diaereses Latin-1 as UTF-8.</p> </li> <li id="'X'-outside-of-string">
<b>'X' outside of string</b> <p>(F) You had a (un)pack template that specified a relative position before the beginning of the string being (un)packed. See <a href="functions/pack">pack</a>.</p> </li> <li id="'x'-outside-of-string-in-unpack">
<b>'x' outside of string in unpack</b> <p>(F) You had a pack template that specified a relative position after the end of the string being unpacked. See <a href="functions/pack">pack</a>.</p> </li> <li id="YOU-HAVEN'T-DISABLED-SET-ID-SCRIPTS-IN-THE-KERNEL-YET!">
<b>YOU HAVEN'T DISABLED SET-ID SCRIPTS IN THE KERNEL YET!</b> <p>(F) And you probably never will, because you probably don't have the sources to your kernel, and your vendor probably doesn't give a rip about what you want. Your best bet is to put a setuid C wrapper around your script.</p> </li> <li id="You-need-to-quote-%22%25s%22">
<b>You need to quote "%s"</b> <p>(W syntax) You assigned a bareword as a signal handler name. Unfortunately, you already have a subroutine of that name declared, which means that Perl 5 will try to call the subroutine when the assignment is executed, which is probably not what you want. (If it IS what you want, put an &amp; in front.)</p> </li> <li id="Your-random-numbers-are-not-that-random">
<b>Your random numbers are not that random</b> <p>(F) When trying to initialize the random seed for hashes, Perl could not get any randomness out of your system. This usually indicates Something Very Wrong.</p> </li> <li id="Zero-length-%5cN%7b%7d-in-regex%3b-marked-by-%3c---HERE-in-m%2f%25s%2f">
<b>Zero length \N{} in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</b> <p>(F) Named Unicode character escapes (<code class="inline">\<span class="i">N</span><span class="s">{</span>...<span class="s">}</span></code> ) may return a zero-length sequence. Such an escape was used in an extended character class, i.e. <code class="inline"><span class="s">(</span><span class="q">?[...])</span></code> , which is not permitted. Check that the correct escape has been used, and the correct charnames handler is in scope. The &lt;-- HERE shows whereabouts in the regular expression the problem was discovered.</p> </li> </ul> <h2 id="SEE-ALSO">SEE ALSO</h2> <p><a href="warnings">warnings</a>, <a href="diagnostics">diagnostics</a>.</p>
