Why must I do this? </h3> <p>(contributed by brian d foy)</p> <p>You might like to read Mark Jason Dominus's "Suffering From Buffering" at <a href="http://perl.plover.com/FAQs/Buffering.html">http://perl.plover.com/FAQs/Buffering.html</a> .</p> <p>Perl normally buffers output so it doesn't make a system call for every bit of output. By saving up output, it makes fewer expensive system calls. For instance, in this little bit of code, you want to print a dot to the screen for every line you process to watch the progress of your program. Instead of seeing a dot for every line, Perl buffers the output and you have a long wait before you see a row of 50 dots all at once:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl"># long wait, then row of dots all at once
while( &lt;&gt; ) {
    print ".";
    print "\n" unless ++$count % 50;

    #... expensive line processing operations
}
</pre>
<p>To get around this, you have to unbuffer the output filehandle, in this case, <code class="inline"><span class="w">STDOUT</span></code> . You can set the special variable <code class="inline"><span class="i">$|</span></code> to a true value (mnemonic: making your filehandles "piping hot"):</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">$|++;

# dot shown immediately
while( &lt;&gt; ) {
    print ".";
    print "\n" unless ++$count % 50;

    #... expensive line processing operations
}
</pre>
<p>The <code class="inline"><span class="i">$|</span></code> is one of the per-filehandle special variables, so each filehandle has its own copy of its value. If you want to merge standard output and standard error for instance, you have to unbuffer each (although STDERR might be unbuffered by default):</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">{
    my $previous_default = select(STDOUT);  # save previous default
    $|++;                                   # autoflush STDOUT
    select(STDERR);
    $|++;                                   # autoflush STDERR, to be sure
    select($previous_default);              # restore previous default
}

# now should alternate . and +
while( 1 ) {
    sleep 1;
    print STDOUT ".";
    print STDERR "+";
    print STDOUT "\n" unless ++$count % 25;
}
</pre>
<p>Besides the <code class="inline"><span class="i">$|</span></code> special variable, you can use <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/binmode">binmode</a></code> to give your filehandle a <code class="inline"><span class="j">:</span><span class="w">unix</span></code> layer, which is unbuffered:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">binmode( STDOUT, ":unix" );

while( 1 ) {
    sleep 1;
    print ".";
    print "\n" unless ++$count % 50;
}
</pre>
<p>For more information on output layers, see the entries for <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/binmode">binmode</a></code> and <a href="open">open</a> in <a href="perlfunc">perlfunc</a>, and the <a href="perlio">PerlIO</a> module documentation.</p> <p>If you are using <a href="io/handle">IO::Handle</a> or one of its subclasses, you can call the <code class="inline"><span class="w">autoflush</span></code> method to change the settings of the filehandle:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">use IO::Handle;
open my( $io_fh ), "&gt;", "output.txt";
$io_fh-&gt;autoflush(1);
</pre>
<p>The <a href="io/handle">IO::Handle</a> objects also have a <code class="inline"><span class="w">flush</span></code> method. You can flush the buffer any time you want without auto-buffering</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">$io_fh-&gt;flush;
</pre>
<h3 id="How-do-I-change%2c-delete%2c-or-insert-a-line-in-a-file%2c-or-append-to-the-beginning-of-a-file%3f">How do I change, delete, or insert a line in a file, or append to the beginning of a file? </h3> <p>(contributed by brian d foy)</p> <p>The basic idea of inserting, changing, or deleting a line from a text file involves reading and printing the file to the point you want to make the change, making the change, then reading and printing the rest of the file. Perl doesn't provide random access to lines (especially since the record input separator, <code class="inline"><span class="i">$/</span></code> , is mutable), although modules such as <a href="tie/file">Tie::File</a> can fake it.</p> <p>A Perl program to do these tasks takes the basic form of opening a file, printing its lines, then closing the file:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">open my $in,  '&lt;',  $file      or die "Can't read old file: $!";
open my $out, '&gt;', "$file.new" or die "Can't write new file: $!";

while( &lt;$in&gt; ) {
        print $out $_;
}

close $out;
</pre>
<p>Within that basic form, add the parts that you need to insert, change, or delete lines.</p> <p>To prepend lines to the beginning, print those lines before you enter the loop that prints the existing lines.</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">open my $in,  '&lt;',  $file      or die "Can't read old file: $!";
open my $out, '&gt;', "$file.new" or die "Can't write new file: $!";

print $out "# Add this line to the top\n"; # &lt;--- HERE'S THE MAGIC

while( &lt;$in&gt; ) {
        print $out $_;
}

close $out;
</pre>
<p>To change existing lines, insert the code to modify the lines inside the <code class="inline">while</code> loop. In this case, the code finds all lowercased versions of "perl" and uppercases them. The happens for every line, so be sure that you're supposed to do that on every line!</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">open my $in,  '&lt;',  $file      or die "Can't read old file: $!";
open my $out, '&gt;', "$file.new" or die "Can't write new file: $!";

print $out "# Add this line to the top\n";

while( &lt;$in&gt; ) {
    s/\b(perl)\b/Perl/g;
    print $out $_;
}

close $out;
</pre>
<p>To change only a particular line, the input line number, <code class="inline"><span class="i">$.</span></code> , is useful. First read and print the lines up to the one you want to change. Next, read the single line you want to change, change it, and print it. After that, read the rest of the lines and print those:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">while( &lt;$in&gt; ) { # print the lines before the change
    print $out $_;
    last if $. == 4; # line number before change
}

my $line = &lt;$in&gt;;
$line =~ s/\b(perl)\b/Perl/g;
print $out $line;

while( &lt;$in&gt; ) { # print the rest of the lines
    print $out $_;
}
</pre>
<p>To skip lines, use the looping controls. The <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/next">next</a></code> in this example skips comment lines, and the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/last">last</a></code> stops all processing once it encounters either <code class="inline">__END__</code> or <code class="inline">__DATA__</code> .</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">while( &lt;$in&gt; ) {
    next if /^\s+#/;             # skip comment lines
    last if /^__(END|DATA)__$/;  # stop at end of code marker
    print $out $_;
}
</pre>
<p>Do the same sort of thing to delete a particular line by using <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/next">next</a></code> to skip the lines you don't want to show up in the output. This example skips every fifth line:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">while( &lt;$in&gt; ) {
    next unless $. % 5;
    print $out $_;
}
</pre>
<p>If, for some odd reason, you really want to see the whole file at once rather than processing line-by-line, you can slurp it in (as long as you can fit the whole thing in memory!):</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">open my $in,  '&lt;',  $file      or die "Can't read old file: $!"
open my $out, '&gt;', "$file.new" or die "Can't write new file: $!";

my $content = do { local $/; &lt;$in&gt; }; # slurp!

    # do your magic here

print $out $content;
</pre>
<p>Modules such as <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc/Path::Tiny">Path::Tiny</a> and <a href="tie/file">Tie::File</a> can help with that too. If you can, however, avoid reading the entire file at once. Perl won't give that memory back to the operating system until the process finishes.</p> <p>You can also use Perl one-liners to modify a file in-place. The following changes all 'Fred' to 'Barney' in <i>inFile.txt</i>, overwriting the file with the new contents. With the <code class="inline">-p</code> switch, Perl wraps a <code class="inline">while</code> loop around the code you specify with <code class="inline">-e</code> , and <code class="inline">-<span class="w">i</span></code> turns on in-place editing. The current line is in <code class="inline"><span class="i">$_</span></code> . With <code class="inline">-p</code> , Perl automatically prints the value of <code class="inline"><span class="i">$_</span></code> at the end of the loop. See <a href="perlrun">perlrun</a> for more details.</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">perl -pi -e 's/Fred/Barney/' inFile.txt
</pre>
<p>To make a backup of <code class="inline"><span class="w">inFile</span>.<span class="w">txt</span></code> , give <code class="inline">-<span class="w">i</span></code> a file extension to add:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">perl -pi.bak -e 's/Fred/Barney/' inFile.txt
</pre>
<p>To change only the fifth line, you can add a test checking <code class="inline"><span class="i">$.</span></code> , the input line number, then only perform the operation when the test passes:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">perl -pi -e 's/Fred/Barney/ if $. == 5' inFile.txt
</pre>
<p>To add lines before a certain line, you can add a line (or lines!) before Perl prints <code class="inline"><span class="i">$_</span></code> :</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">perl -pi -e 'print "Put before third line\n" if $. == 3' inFile.txt
</pre>
<p>You can even add a line to the beginning of a file, since the current line prints at the end of the loop:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">perl -pi -e 'print "Put before first line\n" if $. == 1' inFile.txt
</pre>
<p>To insert a line after one already in the file, use the <code class="inline">-<span class="w">n</span></code> switch. It's just like <code class="inline">-p</code> except that it doesn't print <code class="inline"><span class="i">$_</span></code> at the end of the loop, so you have to do that yourself. In this case, print <code class="inline"><span class="i">$_</span></code> first, then print the line that you want to add.</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">perl -ni -e 'print; print "Put after fifth line\n" if $. == 5' inFile.txt
</pre>
<p>To delete lines, only print the ones that you want.</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">perl -ni -e 'print if /d/' inFile.txt
</pre>
<h3 id="How-do-I-count-the-number-of-lines-in-a-file%3f">How do I count the number of lines in a file? </h3> <p>(contributed by brian d foy)</p> <p>Conceptually, the easiest way to count the lines in a file is to simply read them and count them:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">my $count = 0;
while( &lt;$fh&gt; ) { $count++; }
</pre>
<p>You don't really have to count them yourself, though, since Perl already does that with the <code class="inline"><span class="i">$.</span></code> variable, which is the current line number from the last filehandle read:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">1 while( &lt;$fh&gt; );
my $count = $.;
</pre>
<p>If you want to use <code class="inline"><span class="i">$.</span></code> , you can reduce it to a simple one-liner, like one of these:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">% perl -lne '} print $.; {'    file

% perl -lne 'END { print $. }' file
</pre>
<p>Those can be rather inefficient though. If they aren't fast enough for you, you might just read chunks of data and count the number of newlines:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">my $lines = 0;
open my($fh), '&lt;:raw', $filename or die "Can't open $filename: $!";
while( sysread $fh, $buffer, 4096 ) {
    $lines += ( $buffer =~ tr/\n// );
}
close $fh;

<h3 id="How-do-I-delete-the-last-N-lines-from-a-file%3f">How do I delete the last N lines from a file? </h3> <p>(contributed by brian d foy)</p> <p>The easiest conceptual solution is to count the lines in the file then start at the beginning and print the number of lines (minus the last N) to a new file.</p> <p>Most often, the real question is how you can delete the last N lines without making more than one pass over the file, or how to do it without a lot of copying. The easy concept is the hard reality when you might have millions of lines in your file.</p> <p>One trick is to use <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc/File::ReadBackwards">File::ReadBackwards</a>, which starts at the end of the file. That module provides an object that wraps the real filehandle to make it easy for you to move around the file. Once you get to the spot you need, you can get the actual filehandle and work with it as normal. In this case, you get the file position at the end of the last line you want to keep and truncate the file to that point:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">use File::ReadBackwards;

my $filename = 'test.txt';
my $Lines_to_truncate = 2;

my $bw = File::ReadBackwards-&gt;new( $filename )
    or die "Could not read backwards in [$filename]: $!";

my $lines_from_end = 0;
until( $bw-&gt;eof or $lines_from_end == $Lines_to_truncate ) {
    print "Got: ", $bw-&gt;readline;
    $lines_from_end++;
}

truncate( $filename, $bw-&gt;tell );

<p>The <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc/File::ReadBackwards">File::ReadBackwards</a> module also has the advantage of setting the input record separator to a regular expression.</p> <p>You can also use the <a href="tie/file">Tie::File</a> module which lets you access the lines through a tied array. You can use normal array operations to modify your file, including setting the last index and using <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/splice">splice</a></code>.</p> <h3 id="How-can-I-use-Perl's--i-option-from-within-a-program%3f">How can I use Perl's <code class="inline">-<span class="w">i</span></code> option from within a program? </h3> <p><code class="inline">-<span class="w">i</span></code> sets the value of Perl's <code class="inline"><span class="i">$^I</span></code> variable, which in turn affects the behavior of <code class="inline">&lt;&gt;</code> ; see <a href="perlrun">perlrun</a> for more details.

<p>We've used a hash slice in order to easily handle the fields of each row. Storing the keys in an array makes it easy to operate on them as a group or loop over them with <code class="inline">for</code> . It also avoids polluting the program with global variables and using symbolic references.</p> <h3 id="How-can-I-make-a-filehandle-local-to-a-subroutine%3f-How-do-I-pass-filehandles-between-subroutines%3f-How-do-I-make-an-array-of-filehandles%3f">How can I make a filehandle local to a subroutine? How do I pass filehandles between subroutines? How do I make an array of filehandles? </h3> <p>As of perl5.6, open() autovivifies file and directory handles as references if you pass it an uninitialized scalar variable. You can then pass these references just like any other scalar, and use them in the place of named handles.</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">open my    $fh, $file_name;

open local $fh, $file_name;

print $fh "Hello World!\n";

process_file( $fh );
</pre>
<p>If you like, you can store these filehandles in an array or a hash. If you access them directly, they aren't simple scalars and you need to give <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/print">print</a></code> a little help by placing the filehandle reference in braces. Perl can only figure it out on its own when the filehandle reference is a simple scalar.</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">my @fhs = ( $fh1, $fh2, $fh3 );

for( $i = 0; $i &lt;= $#fhs; $i++ ) {
    print {$fhs[$i]} "just another Perl answer, \n";
}
</pre>
<p>Before perl5.6, you had to deal with various typeglob idioms which you may see in older code.</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">open FILE, "&gt; $filename";
process_typeglob(   *FILE );
process_reference( \*FILE );

sub process_typeglob  { local *FH = shift; print FH  "Typeglob!" }
sub process_reference { local $fh = shift; print $fh "Reference!" }
</pre>
<p>If you want to create many anonymous handles, you should check out the Symbol or IO::Handle modules.</p> <h3 id="How-can-I-use-a-filehandle-indirectly%3f">How can I use a filehandle indirectly? </h3> <p>An indirect filehandle is the use of something other than a symbol in a place that a filehandle is expected. Here are ways to get indirect filehandles:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">$fh =   SOME_FH;       # bareword is strict-subs hostile
$fh =  "SOME_FH";      # strict-refs hostile; same package only
$fh =  *SOME_FH;       # typeglob
$fh = \*SOME_FH;       # ref to typeglob (bless-able)
$fh =  *SOME_FH{IO};   # blessed IO::Handle from *SOME_FH typeglob
</pre>
<p>Or, you can use the <code class="inline"><span class="w">new</span></code> method from one of the IO::* modules to create an anonymous filehandle and store that in a scalar variable.</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">use IO::Handle;                     # 5.004 or higher
my $fh = IO::Handle-&gt;new();
</pre>
<p>Then use any of those as you would a normal filehandle. Anywhere that Perl is expecting a filehandle, an indirect filehandle may be used instead. An indirect filehandle is just a scalar variable that contains a filehandle. Functions like <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/print">print</a></code>, <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/open">open</a></code>, <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/seek">seek</a></code>, or the <code class="inline"><span class="q">&lt;FH&gt;</span></code> diamond operator will accept either a named filehandle or a scalar variable containing one:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">($ifh, $ofh, $efh) = (*STDIN, *STDOUT, *STDERR);
print $ofh "Type it: ";
my $got = &lt;$ifh&gt;
print $efh "What was that: $got";
</pre>
<p>If you're passing a filehandle to a function, you can write the function in two ways:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">sub accept_fh {
    my $fh = shift;
    print $fh "Sending to indirect filehandle\n";
}
</pre>
<p>Or it can localize a typeglob and use the filehandle directly:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">sub accept_fh {
    local *FH = shift;
    print  FH "Sending to localized filehandle\n";
}
</pre>
<p>Both styles work with either objects or typeglobs of real filehandles. (They might also work with strings under some circumstances, but this is risky.)</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">accept_fh(*STDOUT);
accept_fh($handle);
</pre>
<p>In the examples above, we assigned the filehandle to a scalar variable before using it. That is because only simple scalar variables, not expressions or subscripts of hashes or arrays, can be used with built-ins like <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/print">print</a></code>, <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/printf">printf</a></code>, or the diamond operator. Using something other than a simple scalar variable as a filehandle is illegal and won't even compile:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">my @fd = (*STDIN, *STDOUT, *STDERR);
print $fd[1] "Type it: ";                           # WRONG
my $got = &lt;$fd[0]&gt;                                  # WRONG
print $fd[2] "What was that: $got";                 # WRONG
</pre>
<p>With <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/print">print</a></code> and <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/printf">printf</a></code>, you get around this by using a block and an expression where you would place the filehandle:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">print  { $fd[1] } "funny stuff\n";
printf { $fd[1] } "Pity the poor %x.\n", 3_735_928_559;
# Pity the poor deadbeef.
</pre>
<p>That block is a proper block like any other, so you can put more complicated code there. This sends the message out to one of two places:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">my $ok = -x "/bin/cat";
print { $ok ? $fd[1] : $fd[2] } "cat stat $ok\n";
print { $fd[ 1+ ($ok || 0) ]  } "cat stat $ok\n";
</pre>
<p>This approach of treating <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/print">print</a></code> and <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/printf">printf</a></code> like object methods calls doesn't work for the diamond operator. That's because it's a real operator, not just a function with a comma-less argument. Assuming you've been storing typeglobs in your structure as we did above, you can use the built-in function named <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/readline">readline</a></code> to read a record just as <code class="inline">&lt;&gt;</code> does. Given the initialization shown above for @fd, this would work, but only because readline() requires a typeglob. It doesn't work with objects or strings, which might be a bug we haven't fixed yet.</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">$got = readline($fd[0]);
</pre>
<p>Let it be noted that the flakiness of indirect filehandles is not related to whether they're strings, typeglobs, objects, or anything else. It's the syntax of the fundamental operators. Playing the object game doesn't help you at all here.</p> <h3 id="How-can-I-set-up-a-footer-format-to-be-used-with-write()%3f">How can I set up a footer format to be used with write()? </h3> <p>There's no builtin way to do this, but <a href="perlform">perlform</a> has a couple of techniques to make it possible for the intrepid hacker.</p> <h3 id="How-can-I-write()-into-a-string%3f">How can I write() into a string? </h3> <p>(contributed by brian d foy)</p> <p>If you want to <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/write">write</a></code> into a string, you just have to &lt;open&gt; a filehandle to a string, which Perl has been able to do since Perl 5.6:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">open FH, '&gt;', \my $string;
write( FH );
</pre>
<p>Since you want to be a good programmer, you probably want to use a lexical filehandle, even though formats are designed to work with bareword filehandles since the default format names take the filehandle name. However, you can control this with some Perl special per-filehandle variables: <code class="inline"><span class="i">$^</span></code> , which names the top-of-page format, and <code class="inline"><span class="i">$~</span></code> which shows the line format. You have to change the default filehandle to set these variables:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">open my($fh), '&gt;', \my $string;

{ # set per-filehandle variables
    my $old_fh = select( $fh );
    $~ = 'ANIMAL';
    $^ = 'ANIMAL_TOP';
    select( $old_fh );
}

format ANIMAL_TOP =
 ID  Type    Name
.

format ANIMAL =
@##   @&lt;&lt;&lt;    @&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
$id,  $type,  $name
.
</pre>
<p>Although write can work with lexical or package variables, whatever variables you use have to scope in the format. That most likely means you'll want to localize some package variables:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">{
    local( $id, $type, $name ) = qw( 12 cat Buster );
    write( $fh );
}

print $string;
</pre>
<p>There are also some tricks that you can play with <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/formline">formline</a></code> and the accumulator variable <code class="inline"><span class="i">$^A</span></code> , but you lose a lot of the value of formats since <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/formline">formline</a></code> won't handle paging and so on. You end up reimplementing formats when you use them.</p> <h3 id="How-can-I-open-a-filehandle-to-a-string%3f">How can I open a filehandle to a string? </h3> <p>(contributed by Peter J. Holzer, hjp-usenet2@hjp.at)</p> <p>Since Perl 5.8.0 a file handle referring to a string can be created by calling open with a reference to that string instead of the filename. This file handle can then be used to read from or write to the string:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">open(my $fh, '&gt;', \$string) or die "Could not open string for writing";

<p>It may be more portable to use the <a href="file/copy">File::Copy</a> module instead. You just copy to the new file to the new name (checking return values), then delete the old one.

<dd> <p>Some versions of flock() can't lock files over a network (e.g. on NFS file systems), so you'd need to force the use of fcntl(2) when you build Perl. But even this is dubious at best. See the flock entry of <a href="perlfunc">perlfunc</a> and the <i>INSTALL</i> file in the source distribution for information on building Perl to do this.</p> <p>Two potentially non-obvious but traditional flock semantics are that it waits indefinitely until the lock is granted, and that its locks are <i>merely advisory</i>. Such discretionary locks are more flexible, but offer fewer guarantees. This means that files locked with flock() may be modified by programs that do not also use flock(). Cars that stop for red lights get on well with each other, but not with cars that don't stop for red lights. See the perlport manpage, your port's specific documentation, or your system-specific local manpages for details. It's best to assume traditional behavior if you're writing portable programs. (If you're not, you should as always feel perfectly free to write for your own system's idiosyncrasies (sometimes called "features"). Slavish adherence to portability concerns shouldn't get in the way of your getting your job done.)</p> <p>For more information on file locking, see also <a href="perlopentut#File-Locking">File Locking in perlopentut</a> if you have it (new for 5.6).</p> </dd> </dl> <h3 id="Why-can't-I-just-open(FH%2c-%22%3efile.lock%22)%3f">Why can't I just open(FH, "&gt;file.lock")? </h3> <p>A common bit of code <b>NOT TO USE</b> is this:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">sleep(3) while -e 'file.lock';    # PLEASE DO NOT USE

my $date_string = ctime(stat($file)-&gt;mtime);

<p>The POSIX::strftime() approach has the benefit of being, in theory, independent of the current locale.

<h3 id="How-can-I-read-in-an-entire-file-all-at-once%3f">How can I read in an entire file all at once? </h3> <p>The customary Perl approach for processing all the lines in a file is to do so one line at a time:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">open my $input, '&lt;', $file or die "can't open $file: $!";
while (&lt;$input&gt;) {
    chomp;
    # do something with $_

<p>This is tremendously more efficient than reading the entire file into memory as an array of lines and then processing it one element at a time, which is often--if not almost always--the wrong approach. Whenever you see someone do this:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">my @lines = &lt;INPUT&gt;;
</pre>
<p>You should think long and hard about why you need everything loaded at once. It's just not a scalable solution.</p> <p>If you "mmap" the file with the File::Map module from CPAN, you can virtually load the entire file into a string without actually storing it in memory:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">use File::Map qw(map_file);

map_file my $string, $filename;
</pre>
<p>Once mapped, you can treat <code class="inline"><span class="i">$string</span></code> as you would any other string. Since you don't necessarily have to load the data, mmap-ing can be very fast and may not increase your memory footprint.</p> <p>You might also find it more fun to use the standard <a href="tie/file">Tie::File</a> module, or the <a href="db_file">DB_File</a> module's <code class="inline"><span class="i">$DB_RECNO</span></code> bindings, which allow you to tie an array to a file so that accessing an element of the array actually accesses the corresponding line in the file.</p> <p>If you want to load the entire file, you can use the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc/Path::Tiny">Path::Tiny</a> module to do it in one simple and efficient step:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">use Path::Tiny;

my $all_of_it = path($filename)-&gt;slurp; # entire file in scalar
my @all_lines = path($filename)-&gt;lines; # one line per element
</pre>
<p>Or you can read the entire file contents into a scalar like this:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">my $var;
{
    local $/;
    open my $fh, '&lt;', $file or die "can't open $file: $!";
    $var = &lt;$fh&gt;;
}
</pre>
<p>That temporarily undefs your record separator, and will automatically close the file at block exit. If the file is already open, just use this:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">my $var = do { local $/; &lt;$fh&gt; };
</pre>
<p>You can also use a localized <code class="inline"><span class="i">@ARGV</span></code> to eliminate the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/open">open</a></code>:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">my $var = do { local( @ARGV, $/ ) = $file; &lt;&gt; };
</pre>
<p>For ordinary files you can also use the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/read">read</a></code> function.</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">read( $fh, $var, -s $fh );
</pre>
<p>That third argument tests the byte size of the data on the <code class="inline"><span class="i">$fh</span></code> filehandle and reads that many bytes into the buffer <code class="inline"><span class="i">$var</span></code> .</p> <h3 id="How-can-I-read-in-a-file-by-paragraphs%3f">How can I read in a file by paragraphs? </h3> <p>Use the <code class="inline"><span class="i">$/</span></code> variable (see <a href="perlvar">perlvar</a> for details).

<p>If this still doesn't work, look into the <code class="inline"><span class="w">clearerr</span></code> method from <a href="io/handle">IO::Handle</a>, which resets the error and end-of-file states on the handle.</p> <p>There's also a <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc/File::Tail">File::Tail</a> module from CPAN.</p> <h3 id="How-do-I-dup()-a-filehandle-in-Perl%3f">How do I dup() a filehandle in Perl? </h3> <p>If you check <a href="functions/open">open</a>, you'll see that several of the ways to call open() should do the trick. For example:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">open my $log, '&gt;&gt;', '/foo/logfile';
open STDERR, '&gt;&amp;', $log;
</pre>
<p>Or even with a literal numeric descriptor:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">my $fd = $ENV{MHCONTEXTFD};
open $mhcontext, "&lt;&amp;=$fd";  # like fdopen(3S)
</pre>
<p>Note that "&lt;&amp;STDIN" makes a copy, but "&lt;&amp;=STDIN" makes an alias. That means if you close an aliased handle, all aliases become inaccessible. This is not true with a copied one.</p> <p>Error checking, as always, has been left as an exercise for the reader.</p> <h3 id="How-do-I-close-a-file-descriptor-by-number%3f">How do I close a file descriptor by number? </h3> <p>If, for some reason, you have a file descriptor instead of a filehandle (perhaps you used <code class="inline"><span class="w">POSIX::open</span></code> ), you can use the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/close">close()</a></code> function from the <a href="posix">POSIX</a> module:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">use POSIX ();

POSIX::close( $fd );
</pre>
<p>This should rarely be necessary, as the Perl <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/close">close()</a></code> function is to be used for things that Perl opened itself, even if it was a dup of a numeric descriptor as with <code class="inline"><span class="w">MHCONTEXT</span></code> above. But if you really have to, you may be able to do this:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">require 'sys/syscall.ph';
my $rc = syscall(SYS_close(), $fd + 0);  # must force numeric
die "can't sysclose $fd: $!" unless $rc == -1;
</pre>
<p>Or, just use the fdopen(3S) feature of <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/open">open()</a></code>:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">{
    open my $fh, "&lt;&amp;=$fd" or die "Cannot reopen fd=$fd: $!";
    close $fh;
}
</pre>
<h3 id="Why-can't-I-use-%22C%3a%5ctemp%5cfoo%22-in-DOS-paths%3f-Why-doesn't-%60C%3a%5ctemp%5cfoo.exe%60-work%3f">Why can't I use "C:\temp\foo" in DOS paths? Why doesn't `C:\temp\foo.exe` work? </h3> <p>Whoops! You just put a tab and a formfeed into that filename! Remember that within double quoted strings ("like\this"), the backslash is an escape character. The full list of these is in <a href="perlop#Quote-and-Quote-like-Operators">Quote and Quote-like Operators in perlop</a>. Unsurprisingly, you don't have a file called "c:(tab)emp(formfeed)oo" or "c:(tab)emp(formfeed)oo.exe" on your legacy DOS filesystem.</p> <p>Either single-quote your strings, or (preferably) use forward slashes. Since all DOS and Windows versions since something like MS-DOS 2.0 or so have treated <code class="inline">/</code> and <code class="inline">\</code> the same in a path, you might as well use the one that doesn't clash with Perl--or the POSIX shell, ANSI C and C++, awk, Tcl, Java, or Python, just to mention a few. POSIX paths are more portable, too.</p> <h3 id="Why-doesn't-glob(%22*.*%22)-get-all-the-files%3f">Why doesn't glob("*.*") get all the files? </h3> <p>Because even on non-Unix ports, Perl's glob function follows standard Unix globbing semantics. You'll need <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/glob">glob("*")</a></code> to get all (non-hidden) files. This makes glob() portable even to legacy systems. Your port may include proprietary globbing functions as well. Check its documentation for details.</p> <h3 id="Why-does-Perl-let-me-delete-read-only-files%3f-Why-does--i-clobber-protected-files%3f-Isn't-this-a-bug-in-Perl%3f">Why does Perl let me delete read-only files? Why does <code class="inline">-<span class="w">i</span></code> clobber protected files? Isn't this a bug in Perl?</h3> <p>This is elaborately and painstakingly described in the <i>file-dir-perms</i> article in the "Far More Than You Ever Wanted To Know" collection in <a href="http://www.cpan.org/misc/olddoc/FMTEYEWTK.tgz">http://www.cpan.org/misc/olddoc/FMTEYEWTK.tgz</a> .</p> <p>The executive summary: learn how your filesystem works. The permissions on a file say what can happen to the data in that file. The permissions on a directory say what can happen to the list of files in that directory. If you delete a file, you're removing its name from the directory (so the operation depends on the permissions of the directory, not of the file). If you try to write to the file, the permissions of the file govern whether you're allowed to.</p> <h3 id="How-do-I-select-a-random-line-from-a-file%3f">How do I select a random line from a file? </h3> <p>Short of loading the file into a database or pre-indexing the lines in the file, there are a couple of things that you can do.</p> <p>Here's a reservoir-sampling algorithm from the Camel Book:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">srand;
rand($.) &lt; 1 &amp;&amp; ($line = $_) while &lt;&gt;;
</pre>
<p>This has a significant advantage in space over reading the whole file in. You can find a proof of this method in <i>The Art of Computer Programming</i>, Volume 2, Section 3.4.2, by Donald E. Knuth.</p> <p>You can use the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc/File::Random">File::Random</a> module which provides a function for that algorithm:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">use File::Random qw/random_line/;
my $line = random_line($filename);
</pre>
<p>Another way is to use the <a href="tie/file">Tie::File</a> module, which treats the entire file as an array. Simply access a random array element.</p> <h3 id="Why-do-I-get-weird-spaces-when-I-print-an-array-of-lines%3f">Why do I get weird spaces when I print an array of lines?</h3> <p>(contributed by brian d foy)</p> <p>If you are seeing spaces between the elements of your array when you print the array, you are probably interpolating the array in double quotes:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">my @animals = qw(camel llama alpaca vicuna);
print "animals are: @animals\n";
</pre>
<p>It's the double quotes, not the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/print">print</a></code>, doing this. Whenever you interpolate an array in a double quote context, Perl joins the elements with spaces (or whatever is in <code class="inline"><span class="i">$"</span></code> , which is a space by default):</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">animals are: camel llama alpaca vicuna
</pre>
<p>This is different than printing the array without the interpolation:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">my @animals = qw(camel llama alpaca vicuna);
print "animals are: ", @animals, "\n";
</pre>
<p>Now the output doesn't have the spaces between the elements because the elements of <code class="inline"><span class="i">@animals</span></code> simply become part of the list to <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/print">print</a></code>:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">animals are: camelllamaalpacavicuna
</pre>
<p>You might notice this when each of the elements of <code class="inline"><span class="i">@array</span></code> end with a newline. You expect to print one element per line, but notice that every line after the first is indented:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">this is a line
 this is another line
 this is the third line
</pre>
<p>That extra space comes from the interpolation of the array. If you don't want to put anything between your array elements, don't use the array in double quotes. You can send it to print without them:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">print @lines;
</pre>
<h3 id="How-do-I-traverse-a-directory-tree%3f">How do I traverse a directory tree?</h3> <p>(contributed by brian d foy)</p> <p>The <a href="file/find">File::Find</a> module, which comes with Perl, does all of the hard work to traverse a directory structure. It comes with Perl. You simply call the <code class="inline"><span class="w">find</span></code> subroutine with a callback subroutine and the directories you want to traverse:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">use File::Find;

find( \&amp;wanted, @directories );

sub wanted {
    # full path in $File::Find::name
    # just filename in $_
    ... do whatever you want to do ...
}
</pre>
<p>The <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc/File::Find::Closures">File::Find::Closures</a>, which you can download from CPAN, provides many ready-to-use subroutines that you can use with <a href="file/find">File::Find</a>.</p> <p>The <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc/File::Finder">File::Finder</a>, which you can download from CPAN, can help you create the callback subroutine using something closer to the syntax of the <code class="inline"><span class="w">find</span></code> command-line utility:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">use File::Find;
use File::Finder;

my $deep_dirs = File::Finder-&gt;depth-&gt;type('d')-&gt;ls-&gt;exec('rmdir','{}');

find( $deep_dirs-&gt;as_options, @places );
</pre>
<p>The <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc/File::Find::Rule">File::Find::Rule</a> module, which you can download from CPAN, has a similar interface, but does the traversal for you too:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">use File::Find::Rule;

my @files = File::Find::Rule-&gt;file()
                         -&gt;name( '*.pm' )
                         -&gt;in( @INC );
</pre>
<h3 id="How-do-I-delete-a-directory-tree%3f">How do I delete a directory tree?</h3> <p>(contributed by brian d foy)</p> <p>If you have an empty directory, you can use Perl's built-in <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/rmdir">rmdir</a></code>. If the directory is not empty (so, no files or subdirectories), you either have to empty it yourself (a lot of work) or use a module to help you.</p> <p>The <a href="file/path">File::Path</a> module, which comes with Perl, has a <code class="inline"><span class="w">remove_tree</span></code> which can take care of all of the hard work for you:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">use File::Path qw(remove_tree);

remove_tree( @directories );
</pre>
<p>The <a href="file/path">File::Path</a> module also has a legacy interface to the older <code class="inline"><span class="w">rmtree</span></code> subroutine.</p> <h3 id="How-do-I-copy-an-entire-directory%3f">How do I copy an entire directory?</h3> <p>(contributed by Shlomi Fish)</p> <p>To do the equivalent of <code class="inline"><span class="w">cp</span> -R</code> (i.e. copy an entire directory tree recursively) in portable Perl, you'll either need to write something yourself or find a good CPAN module such as <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc/File::Copy::Recursive">File::Copy::Recursive</a>.</p> <h2 id="AUTHOR-AND-COPYRIGHT">AUTHOR AND COPYRIGHT</h2> <p>Copyright (c) 1997-2010 Tom Christiansen, Nathan Torkington, and other authors as noted.
