<h2 id="NAME">NAME</h2> <p>perlunicode - Unicode support in Perl</p> <h2 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h2> <p>If you haven't already, before reading this document, you should become familiar with both <a href="perlunitut">perlunitut</a> and <a href="perluniintro">perluniintro</a>.</p> <p>Unicode aims to <b>UNI</b>-fy the en-<b>CODE</b>-ings of all the world's character sets into a single Standard. For quite a few of the various coding standards that existed when Unicode was first created, converting from each to Unicode essentially meant adding a constant to each code point in the original standard, and converting back meant just subtracting that same constant. For ASCII and ISO-8859-1, the constant is 0. For ISO-8859-5, (Cyrillic) the constant is 864; for Hebrew (ISO-8859-8), it's 1488; Thai (ISO-8859-11), 3424; and so forth. This made it easy to do the conversions, and facilitated the adoption of Unicode.</p> <p>And it worked; nowadays, those legacy standards are rarely used. Most everyone uses Unicode.</p> <p>Unicode is a comprehensive standard. It specifies many things outside the scope of Perl, such as how to display sequences of characters. For a full discussion of all aspects of Unicode, see <a href="http://www.unicode.org">http://www.unicode.org</a>.</p> <h3 id="Important-Caveats">Important Caveats</h3> <p>Even though some of this section may not be understandable to you on first reading, we think it's important enough to highlight some of the gotchas before delving further, so here goes:</p> <p>Unicode support is an extensive requirement. While Perl does not implement the Unicode standard or the accompanying technical reports from cover to cover, Perl does support many Unicode features.</p> <p>Also, the use of Unicode may present security issues that aren't obvious. Read <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc/http:#%2fwww.unicode.org%2freports%2ftr36">Unicode Security Considerations</a>.</p> <ul> <li id="Safest-if-you-use-feature-'unicode_strings'">
<b>Safest if you <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use">use</a> <span class="w">feature</span> <span class="q">'unicode_strings'</span></code> </b> <p>In order to preserve backward compatibility, Perl does not turn on full internal Unicode support unless the pragma <a href="feature#The-'unicode_strings'-feature">use feature 'unicode_strings' </a> is specified. (This is automatically selected if you <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use">use</a> <span class="n">5.012</span></code> or higher.) Failure to do this can trigger unexpected surprises. See <a href="#The-%22Unicode-Bug%22">The Unicode Bug</a> below.</p> <p>This pragma doesn't affect I/O. Nor does it change the internal representation of strings, only their interpretation. There are still several places where Unicode isn't fully supported, such as in filenames.</p> </li> <li id="Input-and-Output-Layers">
<b>Input and Output Layers</b> <p>Use the <code class="inline"><span class="j">:</span><span class="i">encoding</span><span class="s">(</span>...<span class="s">)</span></code> layer to read from and write to filehandles using the specified encoding. (See <a href="open">open</a>.)</p> </li> <li id="You-should-convert-your-non-ASCII%2c-non-UTF-8-Perl-scripts-to-be-UTF-8.">
<b>You should convert your non-ASCII, non-UTF-8 Perl scripts to be UTF-8.</b> <p>See <a href="encoding">encoding</a>.</p> </li> <li id="use-utf8-still-needed-to-enable-%2fUnicode-Encodings-in-scripts">
<b><code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use">use</a> <span class="w">utf8</span></code> still needed to enable <a href="#Unicode-Encodings">UTF-8</a> in scripts</b> <p>If your Perl script is itself encoded in <a href="#Unicode-Encodings">UTF-8</a>, the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use">use</a> <span class="w">utf8</span></code> pragma must be explicitly included to enable recognition of that (in string or regular expression literals, or in identifier names). <b>This is the only time when an explicit <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use">use</a>
<span class="w">utf8</span></code> is needed.</b> (See <a href="utf8">utf8</a>).</p> </li> <li id="BOM-marked-scripts-and-%2fUnicode-Encodings-scripts-autodetected">
<b><code class="inline"><span class="w">BOM</span></code> -marked scripts and <a href="#Unicode-Encodings">UTF-16</a> scripts autodetected</b> <p>However, if a Perl script begins with the Unicode <code class="inline"><span class="w">BOM</span></code> (UTF-16LE, UTF16-BE, or UTF-8), or if the script looks like non-<code class="inline"><span class="w">BOM</span></code> -marked UTF-16 of either endianness, Perl will correctly read in the script as the appropriate Unicode encoding. (<code class="inline"><span class="w">BOM</span></code> -less UTF-8 cannot be effectively recognized or differentiated from ISO 8859-1 or other eight-bit encodings.)</p> </li> </ul> <h3 id="Byte-and-Character-Semantics">Byte and Character Semantics</h3> <p>Before Unicode, most encodings used 8 bits (a single byte) to encode each character. Thus a character was a byte, and a byte was a character, and there could be only 256 or fewer possible characters. "Byte Semantics" in the title of this section refers to this behavior. There was no need to distinguish between "Byte" and "Character".</p> <p>Then along comes Unicode which has room for over a million characters (and Perl allows for even more). This means that a character may require more than a single byte to represent it, and so the two terms are no longer equivalent. What matter are the characters as whole entities, and not usually the bytes that comprise them. That's what the term "Character Semantics" in the title of this section refers to.</p> <p>Perl had to change internally to decouple "bytes" from "characters". It is important that you too change your ideas, if you haven't already, so that "byte" and "character" no longer mean the same thing in your mind.</p> <p>The basic building block of Perl strings has always been a "character". The changes basically come down to that the implementation no longer thinks that a character is always just a single byte.</p> <p>There are various things to note:</p> <ul> <li> <p>String handling functions, for the most part, continue to operate in terms of characters. <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/length">length()</a></code>, for example, returns the number of characters in a string, just as before. But that number no longer is necessarily the same as the number of bytes in the string (there may be more bytes than characters). The other such functions include <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/chop">chop()</a></code>, <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/chomp">chomp()</a></code>, <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/substr">substr()</a></code>, <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/pos">pos()</a></code>, <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/index">index()</a></code>, <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/rindex">rindex()</a></code>, <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/sort">sort()</a></code>, <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/sprintf">sprintf()</a></code>, and <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/write">write()</a></code>.</p> <p>The exceptions are:</p> <ul> <li> <p>the bit-oriented <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/vec">vec</a></code></p>  </li> <li> <p>the byte-oriented <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/pack">pack</a></code>/<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/unpack">unpack</a></code> <code class="inline"><span class="q">"C"</span></code> format</p> <p>However, the <code class="inline"><span class="w">W</span></code> specifier does operate on whole characters, as does the <code class="inline"><span class="w">U</span></code> specifier.</p> </li> <li> <p>some operators that interact with the platform's operating system</p> <p>Operators dealing with filenames are examples.</p> </li> <li> <p>when the functions are called from within the scope of the <code class="inline"><a href="bytes">use bytes</a></code> pragma</p> <p>Likely, you should use this only for debugging anyway.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Strings--including hash keys--and regular expression patterns may contain characters that have ordinal values larger than 255.</p> <p>If you use a Unicode editor to edit your program, Unicode characters may occur directly within the literal strings in UTF-8 encoding, or UTF-16. (The former requires a <code class="inline"><span class="w">BOM</span></code> or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use">use</a> <span class="w">utf8</span></code> , the latter requires a <code class="inline"><span class="w">BOM</span></code> .)</p> <p><a href="perluniintro#Creating-Unicode">Creating Unicode in perluniintro</a> gives other ways to place non-ASCII characters in your strings.</p> </li> <li> <p>The <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/chr">chr()</a></code> and <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/ord">ord()</a></code> functions work on whole characters.</p> </li> <li> <p>Regular expressions match whole characters. For example, <code class="inline"><span class="q">"."</span></code> matches a whole character instead of only a single byte.</p> </li> <li> <p>The <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/tr">tr///</a></code> operator translates whole characters. (Note that the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/tr">tr///CU</a></code> functionality has been removed. For similar functionality to that, see <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/pack">pack</a><span class="s">(</span><span class="q">'U0'</span><span class="cm">,</span> ...<span class="s">)</span></code> and <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/pack">pack</a><span class="s">(</span><span class="q">'C0'</span><span class="cm">,</span> ...<span class="s">)</span></code> ).</p> </li> <li> <p><code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/scalar">scalar</a> <a class="l_k" href="functions/reverse">reverse</a><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code> reverses by character rather than by byte.</p> </li> <li> <p>The bit string operators, <code class="inline"><span class="i">&amp; |</span> ^ ~</code> and (starting in v5.22) <code class="inline"><span class="i">&amp;.</span> |. ^.  ~.</code> can operate on characters that don't fit into a byte. However, the current behavior is likely to change. You should not use these operators on strings that are encoded in UTF-8. If you're not sure about the encoding of a string, downgrade it before using any of these operators; you can use <a href="utf8#Utility-functions">utf8::utf8_downgrade() </a>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The bottom line is that Perl has always practiced "Character Semantics", but with the advent of Unicode, that is now different than "Byte Semantics".</p> <h3 id="ASCII-Rules-versus-Unicode-Rules">ASCII Rules versus Unicode Rules</h3> <p>Before Unicode, when a character was a byte was a character, Perl knew only about the 128 characters defined by ASCII, code points 0 through 127 (except for under <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use">use</a> <span class="w">locale</span></code> ). That left the code points 128 to 255 as unassigned, and available for whatever use a program might want. The only semantics they have is their ordinal numbers, and that they are members of none of the non-negative character classes. None are considered to match <code class="inline">\<span class="w">w</span></code> for example, but all match <code class="inline">\<span class="w">W</span></code> .</p> <p>Unicode, of course, assigns each of those code points a particular meaning (along with ones above 255). To preserve backward compatibility, Perl only uses the Unicode meanings when there is some indication that Unicode is what is intended; otherwise the non-ASCII code points remain treated as if they are unassigned.</p> <p>Here are the ways that Perl knows that a string should be treated as Unicode:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Within the scope of <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use">use</a> <span class="w">utf8</span></code> </p> <p>If the whole program is Unicode (signified by using 8-bit <b>U</b>nicode <b>T</b>ransformation <b>F</b>ormat), then all strings within it must be Unicode.</p> </li> <li> <p>Within the scope of <a href="feature#The-'unicode_strings'-feature">use feature 'unicode_strings' </a></p> <p>This pragma was created so you can explicitly tell Perl that operations executed within its scope are to use Unicode rules. More operations are affected with newer perls. See <a href="#The-%22Unicode-Bug%22">The Unicode Bug</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Within the scope of <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use">use</a> <span class="n">5.012</span></code> or higher</p> <p>This implicitly turns on <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use">use</a> <span class="w">feature</span> <span class="q">'unicode_strings'</span></code> .</p> </li> <li> <p>Within the scope of <a href="perllocale#Unicode-and-UTF-8">use locale 'not_characters' </a>, or <a href="perllocale">use locale </a> and the current locale is a UTF-8 locale.</p> <p>The former is defined to imply Unicode handling; and the latter indicates a Unicode locale, hence a Unicode interpretation of all strings within it.</p> </li> <li> <p>When the string contains a Unicode-only code point</p> <p>Perl has never accepted code points above 255 without them being Unicode, so their use implies Unicode for the whole string.</p> </li> <li> <p>When the string contains a Unicode named code point <code class="inline">\<span class="i">N</span><span class="s">{</span>...<span class="s">}</span></code> </p> <p>The <code class="inline">\<span class="i">N</span><span class="s">{</span>...<span class="s">}</span></code> construct explicitly refers to a Unicode code point, even if it is one that is also in ASCII. Therefore the string containing it must be Unicode.</p> </li> <li> <p>When the string has come from an external source marked as Unicode</p> <p>The <a href="perlrun#-C-%5bnumber%2flist%5d">-C </a> command line option can specify that certain inputs to the program are Unicode, and the values of this can be read by your Perl code, see <a href="perlvar#%24%7b%5eUNICODE%7d">${^UNICODE} in perlvar</a>.</p> </li> <li id="*-When-the-string-has-been-upgraded-to-UTF-8">
<b>When the string has been upgraded to UTF-8</b> <p>The function <a href="utf8#Utility-functions">utf8::utf8_upgrade() </a> can be explicitly used to permanently (unless a subsequent <code class="inline"><span class="i">utf8::utf8_downgrade</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code> is called) cause a string to be treated as Unicode.</p> </li> <li id="*-There-are-additional-methods-for-regular-expression-patterns">
<b>There are additional methods for regular expression patterns</b> <p>A pattern that is compiled with the <code class="inline"><span class="q">/u</span></code> or <code class="inline"><span class="q">/a</span></code> modifiers is treated as Unicode (though there are some restrictions with <code class="inline"><span class="q">/a</span></code> ). Under the <code class="inline">/d</code> and <code class="inline"><span class="q">/l</span></code> modifiers, there are several other indications for Unicode; see <a href="perlre#Character-set-modifiers">Character set modifiers in perlre</a>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Note that all of the above are overridden within the scope of <code class="inline"><a href="bytes">use bytes</a></code>; but you should be using this pragma only for debugging.</p> <p>Note also that some interactions with the platform's operating system never use Unicode rules.</p> <p>When Unicode rules are in effect:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Case translation operators use the Unicode case translation tables.</p> <p>Note that <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/uc">uc()</a></code>, or <code class="inline">\<span class="w">U</span></code> in interpolated strings, translates to uppercase, while <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/ucfirst">ucfirst</a></code>, or <code class="inline">\<span class="w">u</span></code> in interpolated strings, translates to titlecase in languages that make the distinction (which is equivalent to uppercase in languages without the distinction).</p> <p>There is a CPAN module, <code class="inline"><a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc/Unicode::Casing">Unicode::Casing</a></code>, which allows you to define your own mappings to be used in <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/lc">lc()</a></code>, <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/lcfirst">lcfirst()</a></code>, <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/uc">uc()</a></code>, <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/ucfirst">ucfirst()</a></code>, and <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/fc">fc</a></code> (or their double-quoted string inlined versions such as <code class="inline">\<span class="w">U</span></code> ).

See <a href="#User-Defined-Character-Properties">User-Defined Character Properties</a> for more details.</p> </li> </ul> <h3 id="Extended-Grapheme-Clusters-(Logical-characters)">Extended Grapheme Clusters (Logical characters)</h3> <p>Consider a character, say <code class="inline"><span class="w">H</span></code> . It could appear with various marks around it, such as an acute accent, or a circumflex, or various hooks, circles, arrows, <i>etc.</i>, above, below, to one side or the other, <i>etc</i>. There are many possibilities among the world's languages. The number of combinations is astronomical, and if there were a character for each combination, it would soon exhaust Unicode's more than a million possible characters. So Unicode took a different approach: there is a character for the base <code class="inline"><span class="w">H</span></code> , and a character for each of the possible marks, and these can be variously combined to get a final logical character. So a logical character--what appears to be a single character--can be a sequence of more than one individual characters. The Unicode standard calls these "extended grapheme clusters" (which is an improved version of the no-longer much used "grapheme cluster"); Perl furnishes the <code class="inline">\<span class="w">X</span></code> regular expression construct to match such sequences in their entirety.</p> <p>But Unicode's intent is to unify the existing character set standards and practices, and several pre-existing standards have single characters that mean the same thing as some of these combinations, like ISO-8859-1, which has quite a few of them. For example, <code class="inline"><span class="q">"LATIN CAPITAL LETTER E</span>
<span class="q">WITH ACUTE"</span></code> was already in this standard when Unicode came along. Unicode therefore added it to its repertoire as that single character. But this character is considered by Unicode to be equivalent to the sequence consisting of the character <code class="inline"><span class="q">"LATIN CAPITAL LETTER E"</span></code> followed by the character <code class="inline"><span class="q">"COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT"</span></code> .</p> <p><code class="inline"><span class="q">"LATIN CAPITAL LETTER E WITH ACUTE"</span></code> is called a "pre-composed" character, and its equivalence with the "E" and the "COMBINING ACCENT" sequence is called canonical equivalence. All pre-composed characters are said to have a decomposition (into the equivalent sequence), and the decomposition type is also called canonical. A string may be comprised as much as possible of precomposed characters, or it may be comprised of entirely decomposed characters. Unicode calls these respectively, "Normalization Form Composed" (NFC) and "Normalization Form Decomposed". The <code class="inline"><a href="unicode/normalize">Unicode::Normalize</a></code> module contains functions that convert between the two. A string may also have both composed characters and decomposed characters; this module can be used to make it all one or the other.</p> <p>You may be presented with strings in any of these equivalent forms. There is currently nothing in Perl 5 that ignores the differences. So you'll have to specially hanlde it. The usual advice is to convert your inputs to <code class="inline"><span class="w">NFD</span></code> before processing further.</p> <p>For more detailed information, see <a href="http://unicode.org/reports/tr15/">http://unicode.org/reports/tr15/</a>.</p> <h3 id="Unicode-Character-Properties">Unicode Character Properties</h3> <p>(The only time that Perl considers a sequence of individual code points as a single logical character is in the <code class="inline">\<span class="w">X</span></code> construct, already mentioned above. Therefore "character" in this discussion means a single Unicode code point.)</p> <p>Very nearly all Unicode character properties are accessible through regular expressions by using the <code class="inline">\<span class="w">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code> "matches property" construct and the <code class="inline">\<span class="w">P</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code> "doesn't match property" for its negation.</p> <p>For instance, <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">Uppercase</span><span class="s">}</span></code> matches any single character with the Unicode <code class="inline"><span class="q">"Uppercase"</span></code> property, while <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">L</span><span class="s">}</span></code> matches any character with a <code class="inline"><span class="w">General_Category</span></code> of <code class="inline"><span class="q">"L"</span></code> (letter) property (see <a href="#General_Category">General_Category</a> below). Brackets are not required for single letter property names, so <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">L</span><span class="s">}</span></code> is equivalent to <code class="inline">\<span class="w">pL</span></code> .</p> <p>More formally, <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">Uppercase</span><span class="s">}</span></code> matches any single character whose Unicode <code class="inline"><span class="w">Uppercase</span></code> property value is <code class="inline"><span class="w">True</span></code> , and <code class="inline">\<span class="i">P</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">Uppercase</span><span class="s">}</span></code> matches any character whose <code class="inline"><span class="w">Uppercase</span></code> property value is <code class="inline"><span class="w">False</span></code> , and they could have been written as <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">Uppercase</span>=<span class="w">True</span><span class="s">}</span></code> and <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">Uppercase</span>=<span class="w">False</span><span class="s">}</span></code> , respectively.</p> <p>This formality is needed when properties are not binary; that is, if they can take on more values than just <code class="inline"><span class="w">True</span></code> and <code class="inline"><span class="w">False</span></code> . For example, the <code class="inline"><span class="w">Bidi_Class</span></code> property (see <a href="#Bidirectional-Character-Types">Bidirectional Character Types</a> below), can take on several different values, such as <code class="inline"><span class="w">Left</span></code> , <code class="inline"><span class="w">Right</span></code> , <code class="inline"><span class="w">Whitespace</span></code> , and others. To match these, one needs to specify both the property name (<code class="inline"><span class="w">Bidi_Class</span></code> ), AND the value being matched against (<code class="inline"><span class="w">Left</span></code> , <code class="inline"><span class="w">Right</span></code> , <i>etc.</i>). This is done, as in the examples above, by having the two components separated by an equal sign (or interchangeably, a colon), like <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="j">Bidi_Class:</span> <span class="w">Left</span><span class="s">}</span></code> .</p> <p>All Unicode-defined character properties may be written in these compound forms of <code class="inline">\p{<i>property</i>=<i>value</i>}</code> or <code class="inline">\p{<i>property</i>:<i>value</i>}</code>, but Perl provides some additional properties that are written only in the single form, as well as single-form short-cuts for all binary properties and certain others described below, in which you may omit the property name and the equals or colon separator.</p> <p>Most Unicode character properties have at least two synonyms (or aliases if you prefer): a short one that is easier to type and a longer one that is more descriptive and hence easier to understand. Thus the <code class="inline"><span class="q">"L"</span></code> and <code class="inline"><span class="q">"Letter"</span></code> properties above are equivalent and can be used interchangeably. Likewise, <code class="inline"><span class="q">"Upper"</span></code> is a synonym for <code class="inline"><span class="q">"Uppercase"</span></code> , and we could have written <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">Uppercase</span><span class="s">}</span></code> equivalently as <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">Upper</span><span class="s">}</span></code> . Also, there are typically various synonyms for the values the property can be. For binary properties, <code class="inline"><span class="q">"True"</span></code> has 3 synonyms: <code class="inline"><span class="q">"T"</span></code> , <code class="inline"><span class="q">"Yes"</span></code> , and <code class="inline"><span class="q">"Y"</span></code> ; and <code class="inline"><span class="q">"False"</span></code> has correspondingly <code class="inline"><span class="q">"F"</span></code> , <code class="inline"><span class="q">"No"</span></code> , and <code class="inline"><span class="q">"N"</span></code> . But be careful. A short form of a value for one property may not mean the same thing as the same short form for another. Thus, for the <code class="inline"><a href="#General_Category">General_Category</a></code> property, <code class="inline"><span class="q">"L"</span></code> means <code class="inline"><span class="q">"Letter"</span></code> , but for the <a href="#Bidirectional-Character-Types">Bidi_Class </a> property, <code class="inline"><span class="q">"L"</span></code> means <code class="inline"><span class="q">"Left"</span></code> . A complete list of properties and synonyms is in <a href="perluniprops">perluniprops</a>.</p> <p>Upper/lower case differences in property names and values are irrelevant; thus <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">Upper</span><span class="s">}</span></code> means the same thing as <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">upper</span><span class="s">}</span></code> or even <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">UpPeR</span><span class="s">}</span></code> . Similarly, you can add or subtract underscores anywhere in the middle of a word, so that these are also equivalent to <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">U_p_p_e_r</span><span class="s">}</span></code> . And white space is irrelevant adjacent to non-word characters, such as the braces and the equals or colon separators, so <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span>   <span class="w">Upper</span>  <span class="s">}</span></code> and <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span> <span class="j">Upper_case :</span> <span class="w">Y</span> <span class="s">}</span></code> are equivalent to these as well. In fact, white space and even hyphens can usually be added or deleted anywhere. So even <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span> <span class="w">Up</span>-<span class="w">per</span> case = <span class="w">Yes</span><span class="s">}</span></code> is equivalent. All this is called "loose-matching" by Unicode. The few places where stricter matching is used is in the middle of numbers, and in the Perl extension properties that begin or end with an underscore. Stricter matching cares about white space (except adjacent to non-word characters), hyphens, and non-interior underscores.</p> <p>You can also use negation in both <code class="inline">\<span class="w">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code> and <code class="inline">\<span class="w">P</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code> by introducing a caret (<code class="inline">^</code>) between the first brace and the property name: <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">^Tamil</span><span class="s">}</span></code> is equal to <code class="inline">\<span class="i">P</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">Tamil</span><span class="s">}</span></code> .</p> <p>Almost all properties are immune to case-insensitive matching. That is, adding a <code class="inline">/i</code> regular expression modifier does not change what they match. There are two sets that are affected. The first set is <code class="inline"><span class="w">Uppercase_Letter</span></code> , <code class="inline"><span class="w">Lowercase_Letter</span></code> , and <code class="inline"><span class="w">Titlecase_Letter</span></code> , all of which match <code class="inline"><span class="w">Cased_Letter</span></code> under <code class="inline">/i</code> matching. And the second set is <code class="inline"><span class="w">Uppercase</span></code> , <code class="inline"><span class="w">Lowercase</span></code> , and <code class="inline"><span class="w">Titlecase</span></code> , all of which match <code class="inline"><span class="w">Cased</span></code> under <code class="inline">/i</code> matching. This set also includes its subsets <code class="inline"><span class="w">PosixUpper</span></code> and <code class="inline"><span class="w">PosixLower</span></code> both of which under <code class="inline">/i</code> match <code class="inline"><span class="w">PosixAlpha</span></code> . (The difference between these sets is that some things, such as Roman numerals, come in both upper and lower case so they are <code class="inline"><span class="w">Cased</span></code> , but aren't considered letters, so they aren't <code class="inline"><span class="w">Cased_Letter</span></code> 's.)</p> <p>See <a href="#Beyond-Unicode-code-points">Beyond Unicode code points</a> for special considerations when matching Unicode properties against non-Unicode code points.</p> <h4 id="*General_Category*"><b>General_Category</b></h4> <p>Every Unicode character is assigned a general category, which is the "most usual categorization of a character" (from <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44">http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44</a>).</p> <p>The compound way of writing these is like <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">General_Category</span>=<span class="w">Number</span><span class="s">}</span></code> (short: <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="j">gc:</span><span class="w">n</span><span class="s">}</span></code> ). But Perl furnishes shortcuts in which everything up through the equal or colon separator is omitted. So you can instead just write <code class="inline">\<span class="w">pN</span></code> .</p> <p>Here are the short and long forms of the values the <code class="inline"><span class="w">General</span> <span class="w">Category</span></code> property can have:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">Short       Long

<p>This property is always written in the compound form. For example, <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="j">Bidi_Class:</span><span class="w">R</span><span class="s">}</span></code> matches characters that are normally written right to left. Unlike the <code class="inline"><a href="#General_Category">General_Category</a></code> property, this property can have more values added in a future Unicode release. Those listed above comprised the complete set for many Unicode releases, but others were added in Unicode 6.3; you can always find what the current ones are in in <a href="perluniprops">perluniprops</a>. And <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/">http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/</a> describes how to use them.</p> <h4 id="*Scripts*"><b>Scripts</b></h4> <p>The world's languages are written in many different scripts. This sentence (unless you're reading it in translation) is written in Latin, while Russian is written in Cyrillic, and Greek is written in, well, Greek; Japanese mainly in Hiragana or Katakana. There are many more.</p> <p>The Unicode <code class="inline"><span class="w">Script</span></code> and <code class="inline"><span class="w">Script_Extensions</span></code> properties give what script a given character is in. Either property can be specified with the compound form like <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">Script</span>=<span class="w">Hebrew</span><span class="s">}</span></code> (short: <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">sc</span>=<span class="w">hebr</span><span class="s">}</span></code> ), or <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">Script_Extensions</span>=<span class="w">Javanese</span><span class="s">}</span></code> (short: <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">scx</span>=<span class="w">java</span><span class="s">}</span></code> ). In addition, Perl furnishes shortcuts for all <code class="inline"><span class="w">Script</span></code> property names. You can omit everything up through the equals (or colon), and simply write <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">Latin</span><span class="s">}</span></code> or <code class="inline">\<span class="i">P</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">Cyrillic</span><span class="s">}</span></code> . (This is not true for <code class="inline"><span class="w">Script_Extensions</span></code> , which is required to be written in the compound form.)</p> <p>The difference between these two properties involves characters that are used in multiple scripts. For example the digits '0' through '9' are used in many parts of the world. These are placed in a script named <code class="inline"><span class="w">Common</span></code> . Other characters are used in just a few scripts. For example, the <code class="inline"><span class="q">"KATAKANA-HIRAGANA DOUBLE HYPHEN"</span></code> is used in both Japanese scripts, Katakana and Hiragana, but nowhere else. The <code class="inline"><span class="w">Script</span></code> property places all characters that are used in multiple scripts in the <code class="inline"><span class="w">Common</span></code> script, while the <code class="inline"><span class="w">Script_Extensions</span></code> property places those that are used in only a few scripts into each of those scripts; while still using <code class="inline"><span class="w">Common</span></code> for those used in many scripts. Thus both these match:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">"0" =~ /\p{sc=Common}/     # Matches
"0" =~ /\p{scx=Common}/    # Matches
</pre>
<p>and only the first of these match:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">"\N{KATAKANA-HIRAGANA DOUBLE HYPHEN}" =~ /\p{sc=Common}  # Matches
 "\N{KATAKANA-HIRAGANA DOUBLE HYPHEN}" =~ /\p{scx=Common} # No match
</pre>
<p>And only the last two of these match:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">"\N{KATAKANA-HIRAGANA DOUBLE HYPHEN}" =~ /\p{sc=Hiragana}  # No match
 "\N{KATAKANA-HIRAGANA DOUBLE HYPHEN}" =~ /\p{sc=Katakana}  # No match
"\N{KATAKANA-HIRAGANA DOUBLE HYPHEN}" =~ /\p{scx=Hiragana} # Matches
 "\N{KATAKANA-HIRAGANA DOUBLE HYPHEN}" =~ /\p{scx=Katakana} # Matches
</pre>
<p><code class="inline"><span class="w">Script_Extensions</span></code> is thus an improved <code class="inline"><span class="w">Script</span></code> , in which there are fewer characters in the <code class="inline"><span class="w">Common</span></code> script, and correspondingly more in other scripts. It is new in Unicode version 6.0, and its data are likely to change significantly in later releases, as things get sorted out. New code should probably be using <code class="inline"><span class="w">Script_Extensions</span></code> and not plain <code class="inline"><span class="w">Script</span></code> .</p> <p>(Actually, besides <code class="inline"><span class="w">Common</span></code> , the <code class="inline"><span class="w">Inherited</span></code> script, contains characters that are used in multiple scripts. These are modifier characters which inherit the script value of the controlling character. Some of these are used in many scripts, and so go into <code class="inline"><span class="w">Inherited</span></code> in both <code class="inline"><span class="w">Script</span></code> and <code class="inline"><span class="w">Script_Extensions</span></code> . Others are used in just a few scripts, so are in <code class="inline"><span class="w">Inherited</span></code> in <code class="inline"><span class="w">Script</span></code> , but not in <code class="inline"><span class="w">Script_Extensions</span></code> .)</p> <p>It is worth stressing that there are several different sets of digits in Unicode that are equivalent to 0-9 and are matchable by <code class="inline">\<span class="w">d</span></code> in a regular expression. If they are used in a single language only, they are in that language's <code class="inline"><span class="w">Script</span></code> and <code class="inline"><span class="w">Script_Extension</span></code> . If they are used in more than one script, they will be in <code class="inline"><span class="w">sc</span>=<span class="w">Common</span></code> , but only if they are used in many scripts should they be in <code class="inline"><span class="w">scx</span>=<span class="w">Common</span></code> .</p> <p>A complete list of scripts and their shortcuts is in <a href="perluniprops">perluniprops</a>.</p> <h4 id="*Use-of-the-%22Is%22-Prefix*"><b>Use of the <code class="inline"><span class="q">"Is"</span></code> Prefix</b></h4> <p>For backward compatibility (with Perl 5.6), all properties writable without using the compound form mentioned so far may have <code class="inline"><span class="w">Is</span></code> or <code class="inline"><span class="w">Is_</span></code> prepended to their name, so <code class="inline">\<span class="i">P</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">Is_Lu</span><span class="s">}</span></code> , for example, is equal to <code class="inline">\<span class="i">P</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">Lu</span><span class="s">}</span></code> , and <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="j">IsScript:</span><span class="w">Arabic</span><span class="s">}</span></code> is equal to <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">Arabic</span><span class="s">}</span></code> .</p> <h4 id="*Blocks*"><b>Blocks</b></h4> <p>In addition to <b>scripts</b>, Unicode also defines <b>blocks</b> of characters. The difference between scripts and blocks is that the concept of scripts is closer to natural languages, while the concept of blocks is more of an artificial grouping based on groups of Unicode characters with consecutive ordinal values. For example, the <code class="inline"><span class="q">"Basic Latin"</span></code> block is all the characters whose ordinals are between 0 and 127, inclusive; in other words, the ASCII characters. The <code class="inline"><span class="q">"Latin"</span></code> script contains some letters from this as well as several other blocks, like <code class="inline"><span class="q">"Latin-1 Supplement"</span></code> , <code class="inline"><span class="q">"Latin Extended-A"</span></code> , <i>etc.</i>, but it does not contain all the characters from those blocks. It does not, for example, contain the digits 0-9, because those digits are shared across many scripts, and hence are in the <code class="inline"><span class="w">Common</span></code> script.</p> <p>For more about scripts versus blocks, see UAX#24 "Unicode Script Property": <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr24">http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr24</a></p> <p>The <code class="inline"><span class="w">Script</span></code> or <code class="inline"><span class="w">Script_Extensions</span></code> properties are likely to be the ones you want to use when processing natural language; the <code class="inline"><span class="w">Block</span></code> property may occasionally be useful in working with the nuts and bolts of Unicode.</p> <p>Block names are matched in the compound form, like <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="j">Block:</span> <span class="w">Arrows</span><span class="s">}</span></code> or <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">Blk</span>=<span class="w">Hebrew</span><span class="s">}</span></code> . Unlike most other properties, only a few block names have a Unicode-defined short name. But Perl does provide a (slight, no longer recommended) shortcut: You can say, for example <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">In_Arrows</span><span class="s">}</span></code> or <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">In_Hebrew</span><span class="s">}</span></code> .</p> <p>For backwards compatibility, the <code class="inline"><span class="w">In</span></code> prefix may be omitted if there is no naming conflict with a script or any other property, and you can even use an <code class="inline"><span class="w">Is</span></code> prefix instead in those cases. But don't do this for new code because your code could break in new releases, and this has already happened: There was a time in very early Unicode releases when <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">Hebrew</span><span class="s">}</span></code> would have matched the <i>block</i> Hebrew; now it doesn't.</p> <p>Using the <code class="inline"><span class="w">In</span></code> prefix avoids this ambiguity, so far. But new versions of Unicode continue to add new properties whose names begin with <code class="inline"><span class="w">In</span></code> . There is a possibility that one of them someday will conflict with your usage. Since this is just a Perl extension, Unicode's name will take precedence and your code will become broken. Also, Unicode is free to add a script whose name begins with <code class="inline"><span class="w">In</span></code> ; that would cause problems.</p> <p>So it's clearer and best to use the compound form when specifying blocks. And be sure that is what you really really want to do. In most cases scripts are what you want instead.</p> <p>A complete list of blocks and their shortcuts is in <a href="perluniprops">perluniprops</a>.</p> <h4 id="*Other-Properties*"><b>Other Properties</b></h4> <p>There are many more properties than the very basic ones described here. A complete list is in <a href="perluniprops">perluniprops</a>.</p> <p>Unicode defines all its properties in the compound form, so all single-form properties are Perl extensions.

On the other hand, <code class="inline">U+1EFF</code> was not assigned until version 5.1 when it became <code class="inline"><span class="q">"LATIN SMALL LETTER Y WITH LOOP"</span></code> , so the only "*" that would match it are 5.1, 5.2, and later.</p> <p>Unicode furnishes the <code class="inline"><span class="w">Age</span></code> property from which this is derived. The problem with Age is that a strict interpretation of it (which Perl takes) has it matching the precise release a code point's meaning is introduced in. Thus <code class="inline"><span class="w">U</span>+<span class="n">0041</span></code> would match only 1.1; and <code class="inline">U+1EFF</code> only 5.1.

This is because 66 code points will always be unassigned, and so the <code class="inline"><span class="w">Age</span></code> for them is the Unicode version in which the decision to make them so was made. For example, <code class="inline"><span class="w">U</span>+<span class="w">FDD0</span></code> is to be permanently unassigned to a character, and the decision to do that was made in version 3.1, so <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">Age</span>=<span class="n">3.1</span><span class="s">}</span></code> matches this character, as also does <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="j">Present_In:</span> <span class="n">3.1</span><span class="s">}</span></code> and up.</p> </li> <li id="*%5cp%7bPrint%7d*">

<p>Note that the effect is compile-time and immutable once defined. However, the subroutines are passed a single parameter, which is 0 if case-sensitive matching is in effect and non-zero if caseless matching is in effect.

<p>Suppose you wanted to match only the allocated characters, not the raw block ranges: in other words, you want to remove the unassigned characters:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">sub InKana {

+utf8::InHiragana
+utf8::InKatakana

!utf8::InHiragana
-utf8::InKatakana
+utf8::IsCn
END

<p>This will match all non-Unicode code points, since every one of them is not in Kana. You can use intersection to exclude these, if desired, as this modified example shows:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">sub InNotKana {

</li> </ul> <h3 id="Unicode-Encodings">Unicode Encodings</h3> <p>Unicode characters are assigned to <i>code points</i>, which are abstract numbers. To use these numbers, various encodings are needed.</p> <ul> <li> <p>UTF-8</p> <p>UTF-8 is a variable-length (1 to 4 bytes), byte-order independent encoding. In most of Perl's documentation, including elsewhere in this document, the term "UTF-8" means also "UTF-EBCDIC". But in this section, "UTF-8" refers only to the encoding used on ASCII platforms. It is a superset of 7-bit US-ASCII, so anything encoded in ASCII has the identical representation when encoded in UTF-8.</p> <p>The following table is from Unicode 3.2.</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">Code Points            1st Byte  2nd Byte  3rd Byte 4th Byte

<p>Note the gaps marked by "*" before several of the byte entries above. These are caused by legal UTF-8 avoiding non-shortest encodings: it is technically possible to UTF-8-encode a single code point in different ways, but that is explicitly forbidden, and the shortest possible encoding should always be used (and that is what Perl does).</p> <p>Another way to look at it is via bits:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">               Code Points  1st Byte  2nd Byte  3rd Byte  4th Byte

</pre>
<p>As you can see, the continuation bytes all begin with <code class="inline"><span class="q">"10"</span></code> , and the leading bits of the start byte tell how many bytes there are in the encoded character.</p> <p>The original UTF-8 specification allowed up to 6 bytes, to allow encoding of numbers up to <code class="inline"><span class="n">0x7FFF_FFFF</span></code> . Perl continues to allow those, and has extended that up to 13 bytes to encode code points up to what can fit in a 64-bit word. However, Perl will warn if you output any of these as being non-portable; and under strict UTF-8 input protocols, they are forbidden.</p> </li> <li> <p>UTF-EBCDIC</p> <p>Like UTF-8, but EBCDIC-safe, in the way that UTF-8 is ASCII-safe. This means that all the basic characters (which includes all those that have ASCII equivalents (like <code class="inline"><span class="q">"A"</span></code> , <code class="inline"><span class="q">"0"</span></code> , <code class="inline"><span class="q">"%"</span></code> , <i>etc.</i>) are the same in both EBCDIC and UTF-EBCDIC.)</p> <p>UTF-EBCDIC is used on EBCDIC platforms. The largest Unicode code points take 5 bytes to represent (instead of 4 in UTF-8), and Perl extends it to a maximum of 7 bytes to encode pode points up to what can fit in a 32-bit word (instead of 13 bytes and a 64-bit word in UTF-8).</p> </li> <li> <p>UTF-16, UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE, Surrogates, and <code class="inline"><span class="w">BOM</span></code> 's (Byte Order Marks)</p> <p>The followings items are mostly for reference and general Unicode knowledge, Perl doesn't use these constructs internally.</p> <p>Like UTF-8, UTF-16 is a variable-width encoding, but where UTF-8 uses 8-bit code units, UTF-16 uses 16-bit code units. All code points occupy either 2 or 4 bytes in UTF-16: code points <code class="inline"><span class="w">U</span>+<span class="n">0000</span>..<span class="w">U</span>+<span class="w">FFFF</span></code> are stored in a single 16-bit unit, and code points <code class="inline">U+10000..U+10FFFF</code> in two 16-bit units. The latter case is using <i>surrogates</i>, the first 16-bit unit being the <i>high surrogate</i>, and the second being the <i>low surrogate</i>.</p> <p>Surrogates are code points set aside to encode the <code class="inline">U+10000..U+10FFFF</code> range of Unicode code points in pairs of 16-bit units. The <i>high surrogates</i> are the range <code class="inline"><span class="w">U</span>+<span class="w">D800</span>..<span class="w">U</span>+<span class="w">DBFF</span></code> and the <i>low surrogates</i> are the range <code class="inline"><span class="w">U</span>+<span class="w">DC00</span>..<span class="w">U</span>+<span class="w">DFFF</span></code> . The surrogate encoding is</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">$hi = ($uni - 0x10000) / 0x400 + 0xD800;
$lo = ($uni - 0x10000) % 0x400 + 0xDC00;

<p>and the decoding is</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">$uni = 0x10000 + ($hi - 0xD800) * 0x400 + ($lo - 0xDC00);
</pre>
<p>Because of the 16-bitness, UTF-16 is byte-order dependent. UTF-16 itself can be used for in-memory computations, but if storage or transfer is required either UTF-16BE (big-endian) or UTF-16LE (little-endian) encodings must be chosen.</p> <p>This introduces another problem: what if you just know that your data is UTF-16, but you don't know which endianness? Byte Order Marks, or <code class="inline"><span class="w">BOM</span></code> 's, are a solution to this. A special character has been reserved in Unicode to function as a byte order marker: the character with the code point <code class="inline"><span class="w">U</span>+<span class="w">FEFF</span></code> is the <code class="inline"><span class="w">BOM</span></code> .</p> <p>The trick is that if you read a <code class="inline"><span class="w">BOM</span></code> , you will know the byte order, since if it was written on a big-endian platform, you will read the bytes <code class="inline">0xFE 0xFF</code>, but if it was written on a little-endian platform, you will read the bytes <code class="inline">0xFF 0xFE</code>. (And if the originating platform was writing in ASCII platform UTF-8, you will read the bytes <code class="inline">0xEF 0xBB 0xBF</code>.)</p> <p>The way this trick works is that the character with the code point <code class="inline"><span class="w">U</span>+<span class="w">FFFE</span></code> is not supposed to be in input streams, so the sequence of bytes <code class="inline">0xFF 0xFE</code> is unambiguously "<code class="inline"><span class="w">BOM</span></code> , represented in little-endian format" and cannot be <code class="inline"><span class="w">U</span>+<span class="w">FFFE</span></code> , represented in big-endian format".</p> <p>Surrogates have no meaning in Unicode outside their use in pairs to represent other code points. However, Perl allows them to be represented individually internally, for example by saying <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/chr">chr(0xD801)</a></code>, so that all code points, not just those valid for open interchange, are representable. Unicode does define semantics for them, such as their <code class="inline"><a href="#General_Category">General_Category</a></code> is <code class="inline"><span class="q">"Cs"</span></code> . But because their use is somewhat dangerous, Perl will warn (using the warning category <code class="inline"><span class="q">"surrogate"</span></code> , which is a sub-category of <code class="inline"><span class="q">"utf8"</span></code> ) if an attempt is made to do things like take the lower case of one, or match case-insensitively, or to output them. (But don't try this on Perls before 5.14.)</p> </li> <li> <p>UTF-32, UTF-32BE, UTF-32LE</p> <p>The UTF-32 family is pretty much like the UTF-16 family, except that the units are 32-bit, and therefore the surrogate scheme is not needed. UTF-32 is a fixed-width encoding. The <code class="inline"><span class="w">BOM</span></code> signatures are <code class="inline">0x00 0x00 0xFE 0xFF</code> for BE and <code class="inline">0xFF 0xFE 0x00 0x00</code> for LE.</p> </li> <li> <p>UCS-2, UCS-4</p> <p>Legacy, fixed-width encodings defined by the ISO 10646 standard. UCS-2 is a 16-bit encoding. Unlike UTF-16, UCS-2 is not extensible beyond <code class="inline"><span class="w">U</span>+<span class="w">FFFF</span></code> , because it does not use surrogates. UCS-4 is a 32-bit encoding, functionally identical to UTF-32 (the difference being that UCS-4 forbids neither surrogates nor code points larger than <code class="inline"><span class="n">0x10_FFFF</span></code> ).</p> </li> <li> <p>UTF-7</p> <p>A seven-bit safe (non-eight-bit) encoding, which is useful if the transport or storage is not eight-bit safe.

<p>Until Unicode 7.0, the noncharacters were "<b>forbidden</b> for use in open interchange of Unicode text data", so that code that processed those streams could use these code points as sentinels that could be mixed in with character data, and would always be distinguishable from that data. (Emphasis above and in the next paragraph are added in this document.)</p> <p>Unicode 7.0 changed the wording so that they are "<b>not recommended</b> for use in open interchange of Unicode text data". The 7.0 Standard goes on to say:</p> <p>This change was made because it was found that various commercial tools like editors, or for things like source code control, had been written so that they would not handle program files that used these code points, effectively precluding their use almost entirely! And that was never the intent. They've always been meant to be usable within an application, or cooperating set of applications, at will.</p> <p>If you're writing code, such as an editor, that is supposed to be able to handle any Unicode text data, then you shouldn't be using these code points yourself, and instead allow them in the input. If you need sentinels, they should instead be something that isn't legal Unicode. For UTF-8 data, you can use the bytes 0xC1 and 0xC2 as sentinels, as they never appear in well-formed UTF-8. (There are equivalents for UTF-EBCDIC). You can also store your Unicode code points in integer variables and use negative values as sentinels.</p> <p>If you're not writing such a tool, then whether you accept noncharacters as input is up to you (though the Standard recommends that you not). If you do strict input stream checking with Perl, these code points continue to be forbidden. This is to maintain backward compatibility (otherwise potential security holes could open up, as an unsuspecting application that was written assuming the noncharacters would be filtered out before getting to it, could now, without warning, start getting them). To do strict checking, you can use the layer <code class="inline"><span class="j">:</span><span class="i">encoding</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="q">'UTF-8'</span><span class="s">)</span></code> .</p> <p>Perl continues to warn (using the warning category <code class="inline"><span class="q">"nonchar"</span></code> , which is a sub-category of <code class="inline"><span class="q">"utf8"</span></code> ) if an attempt is made to output noncharacters.</p> <h3 id="Beyond-Unicode-code-points">Beyond Unicode code points</h3> <p>The maximum Unicode code point is <code class="inline"><span class="w">U</span>+<span class="n">10</span><span class="w">FFFF</span></code> , and Unicode only defines operations on code points up through that. But Perl works on code points up to the maximum permissible unsigned number available on the platform. However, Perl will not accept these from input streams unless lax rules are being used, and will warn (using the warning category <code class="inline"><span class="q">"non_unicode"</span></code> , which is a sub-category of <code class="inline"><span class="q">"utf8"</span></code> ) if any are output.</p> <p>Since Unicode rules are not defined on these code points, if a Unicode-defined operation is done on them, Perl uses what we believe are sensible rules, while generally warning, using the <code class="inline"><span class="q">"non_unicode"</span></code> category. For example, <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/uc">uc("\x{11_0000}")</a></code> will generate such a warning, returning the input parameter as its result, since Perl defines the uppercase of every non-Unicode code point to be the code point itself. (All the case changing operations, not just uppercasing, work this way.)</p> <p>The situation with matching Unicode properties in regular expressions, the <code class="inline">\<span class="w">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code> and <code class="inline">\<span class="w">P</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code> constructs, against these code points is not as clear cut, and how these are handled has changed as we've gained experience.</p> <p>One possibility is to treat any match against these code points as undefined. But since Perl doesn't have the concept of a match being undefined, it converts this to failing or <code class="inline"><span class="w">FALSE</span></code> . This is almost, but not quite, what Perl did from v5.14 (when use of these code points became generally reliable) through v5.18. The difference is that Perl treated all <code class="inline">\<span class="w">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code> matches as failing, but all <code class="inline">\<span class="w">P</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code> matches as succeeding.</p> <p>One problem with this is that it leads to unexpected, and confusting results in some cases:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">chr(0x110000) =~ \p{ASCII_Hex_Digit=True}      # Failed on &lt;= v5.18
chr(0x110000) =~ \p{ASCII_Hex_Digit=False}     # Failed! on &lt;= v5.18
</pre>
<p>That is, it treated both matches as undefined, and converted that to false (raising a warning on each). The first case is the expected result, but the second is likely counterintuitive: "How could both be false when they are complements?" Another problem was that the implementation optimized many Unicode property matches down to already existing simpler, faster operations, which don't raise the warning. We chose to not forgo those optimizations, which help the vast majority of matches, just to generate a warning for the unlikely event that an above-Unicode code point is being matched against.</p> <p>As a result of these problems, starting in v5.20, what Perl does is to treat non-Unicode code points as just typical unassigned Unicode characters, and matches accordingly. (Note: Unicode has atypical unassigned code points. For example, it has noncharacter code points, and ones that, when they do get assigned, are destined to be written Right-to-left, as Arabic and Hebrew are. Perl assumes that no non-Unicode code point has any atypical properties.)</p> <p>Perl, in most cases, will raise a warning when matching an above-Unicode code point against a Unicode property when the result is <code class="inline"><span class="w">TRUE</span></code> for <code class="inline">\<span class="w">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code> , and <code class="inline"><span class="w">FALSE</span></code> for <code class="inline">\<span class="w">P</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code> . For example:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">chr(0x110000) =~ \p{ASCII_Hex_Digit=True}      # Fails, no warning
chr(0x110000) =~ \p{ASCII_Hex_Digit=False}     # Succeeds, with warning
</pre>
<p>In both these examples, the character being matched is non-Unicode, so Unicode doesn't define how it should match. It clearly isn't an ASCII hex digit, so the first example clearly should fail, and so it does, with no warning. But it is arguable that the second example should have an undefined, hence <code class="inline"><span class="w">FALSE</span></code> , result. So a warning is raised for it.</p> <p>Thus the warning is raised for many fewer cases than in earlier Perls, and only when what the result is could be arguable. It turns out that none of the optimizations made by Perl (or are ever likely to be made) cause the warning to be skipped, so it solves both problems of Perl's earlier approach. The most commonly used property that is affected by this change is <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">Unassigned</span><span class="s">}</span></code> which is a short form for <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">General_Category</span>=<span class="w">Unassigned</span><span class="s">}</span></code> . Starting in v5.20, all non-Unicode code points are considered <code class="inline"><span class="w">Unassigned</span></code> . In earlier releases the matches failed because the result was considered undefined.</p> <p>The only place where the warning is not raised when it might ought to have been is if optimizations cause the whole pattern match to not even be attempted. For example, Perl may figure out that for a string to match a certain regular expression pattern, the string has to contain the substring <code class="inline"><span class="q">"foobar"</span></code> . Before attempting the match, Perl may look for that substring, and if not found, immediately fail the match without actually trying it; so no warning gets generated even if the string contains an above-Unicode code point.</p> <p>This behavior is more "Do what I mean" than in earlier Perls for most applications. But it catches fewer issues for code that needs to be strictly Unicode compliant. Therefore there is an additional mode of operation available to accommodate such code. This mode is enabled if a regular expression pattern is compiled within the lexical scope where the <code class="inline"><span class="q">"non_unicode"</span></code> warning class has been made fatal, say by:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">use warnings FATAL =&gt; "non_unicode"
</pre>
<p>(see <a href="warnings">warnings</a>). In this mode of operation, Perl will raise the warning for all matches against a non-Unicode code point (not just the arguable ones), and it skips the optimizations that might cause the warning to not be output. (It currently still won't warn if the match isn't even attempted, like in the <code class="inline"><span class="q">"foobar"</span></code> example above.)</p> <p>In summary, Perl now normally treats non-Unicode code points as typical Unicode unassigned code points for regular expression matches, raising a warning only when it is arguable what the result should be. However, if this warning has been made fatal, it isn't skipped.</p> <p>There is one exception to all this. <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">All</span><span class="s">}</span></code> looks like a Unicode property, but it is a Perl extension that is defined to be true for all possible code points, Unicode or not, so no warning is ever generated when matching this against a non-Unicode code point. (Prior to v5.20, it was an exact synonym for <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">Any</span><span class="s">}</span></code> , matching code points <code class="inline"><span class="n">0</span></code> through <code class="inline"><span class="n">0x10FFFF</span></code> .)</p> <h3 id="Security-Implications-of-Unicode">Security Implications of Unicode</h3> <p>First, read <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc/http:#%2fwww.unicode.org%2freports%2ftr36">Unicode Security Considerations</a>.</p> <p>Also, note the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Malformed UTF-8</p> <p>Unfortunately, the original specification of UTF-8 leaves some room for interpretation of how many bytes of encoded output one should generate from one input Unicode character. Strictly speaking, the shortest possible sequence of UTF-8 bytes should be generated, because otherwise there is potential for an input buffer overflow at the receiving end of a UTF-8 connection. Perl always generates the shortest length UTF-8, and with warnings on, Perl will warn about non-shortest length UTF-8 along with other malformations, such as the surrogates, which are not Unicode code points valid for interchange.</p> </li> <li> <p>Regular expression pattern matching may surprise you if you're not accustomed to Unicode. Starting in Perl 5.14, several pattern modifiers are available to control this, called the character set modifiers. Details are given in <a href="perlre#Character-set-modifiers">Character set modifiers in perlre</a>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>As discussed elsewhere, Perl has one foot (two hooves?) planted in each of two worlds: the old world of ASCII and single-byte locales, and the new world of Unicode, upgrading when necessary. If your legacy code does not explicitly use Unicode, no automatic switch-over to Unicode should happen.</p> <h3 id="Unicode-in-Perl-on-EBCDIC">Unicode in Perl on EBCDIC</h3> <p>Unicode is supported on EBCDIC platforms. See <a href="perlebcdic">perlebcdic</a>.</p> <p>Unless ASCII vs. EBCDIC issues are specifically being discussed, references to UTF-8 encoding in this document and elsewhere should be read as meaning UTF-EBCDIC on EBCDIC platforms. See <a href="perlebcdic#Unicode-and-UTF">Unicode and UTF in perlebcdic</a>.</p> <p>Because UTF-EBCDIC is so similar to UTF-8, the differences are mostly hidden from you; <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use">use</a> <span class="w">utf8</span></code> (and NOT something like <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use">use</a> <span class="w">utfebcdic</span></code> ) declares the the script is in the platform's "native" 8-bit encoding of Unicode. (Similarly for the <code class="inline"><span class="q">":utf8"</span></code> layer.)</p> <h3 id="Locales">Locales</h3> <p>See <a href="perllocale#Unicode-and-UTF-8">Unicode and UTF-8 in perllocale</a></p> <h3 id="When-Unicode-Does-Not-Happen">When Unicode Does Not Happen</h3> <p>There are still many places where Unicode (in some encoding or another) could be given as arguments or received as results, or both in Perl, but it is not, in spite of Perl having extensive ways to input and output in Unicode, and a few other "entry points" like the <code class="inline"><span class="i">@ARGV</span></code> array (which can sometimes be interpreted as UTF-8).</p> <p>The following are such interfaces. Also, see <a href="#The-%22Unicode-Bug%22">The Unicode Bug</a>. For all of these interfaces Perl currently (as of v5.16.0) simply assumes byte strings both as arguments and results, or UTF-8 strings if the (deprecated) <code class="inline"><span class="w">encoding</span></code> pragma has been used.</p> <p>One reason that Perl does not attempt to resolve the role of Unicode in these situations is that the answers are highly dependent on the operating system and the file system(s). For example, whether filenames can be in Unicode and in exactly what kind of encoding, is not exactly a portable concept.

Without a locale specified, unlike all other characters or code points, these characters can have very different semantics depending on the rules in effect. (Characters whose code points are above 255 force Unicode rules; whereas the rules for ASCII characters are the same under both ASCII and Unicode rules.)</p> <p>Under Unicode rules, these upper-Latin1 characters are interpreted as Unicode code points, which means they have the same semantics as Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1) and C1 controls.</p> <p>As explained in <a href="#ASCII-Rules-versus-Unicode-Rules">ASCII Rules versus Unicode Rules</a>, under ASCII rules, they are considered to be unassigned characters.</p> <p>This can lead to unexpected results. For example, a string's semantics can suddenly change if a code point above 255 is appended to it, which changes the rules from ASCII to Unicode. As an example, consider the following program and its output:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">$ perl -le'
         no feature 'unicode_strings';
         $s1 = "\xC2";
         $s2 = "\x{2660}";
         for ($s1, $s2, $s1.$s2) {

But the result turned out to not be seamless. (By the way, you can choose to be warned when things like this happen. See <code class="inline"><a href="encoding/warnings">encoding::warnings</a></code>.)</p> <p><a href="feature#The-'unicode_strings'-feature">use feature 'unicode_strings' </a> was added, starting in Perl v5.12, to address this problem.

</pre>
</li> </ul> <h2 id="BUGS">BUGS</h2> <p>See also <a href="#The-%22Unicode-Bug%22">The Unicode Bug</a> above.</p> <h3 id="Interaction-with-Extensions">Interaction with Extensions</h3> <p>When Perl exchanges data with an extension, the extension should be able to understand the UTF8 flag and act accordingly. If the extension doesn't recognize that flag, it's likely that the extension will return incorrectly-flagged data.</p> <p>So if you're working with Unicode data, consult the documentation of every module you're using if there are any issues with Unicode data exchange. If the documentation does not talk about Unicode at all, suspect the worst and probably look at the source to learn how the module is implemented. Modules written completely in Perl shouldn't cause problems. Modules that directly or indirectly access code written in other programming languages are at risk.</p> <p>For affected functions, the simple strategy to avoid data corruption is to always make the encoding of the exchanged data explicit. Choose an encoding that you know the extension can handle. Convert arguments passed to the extensions to that encoding and convert results back from that encoding. Write wrapper functions that do the conversions for you, so you can later change the functions when the extension catches up.</p> <p>To provide an example, let's say the popular <code class="inline"><span class="w">Foo::Bar::escape_html</span></code> function doesn't deal with Unicode data yet. The wrapper function would convert the argument to raw UTF-8 and convert the result back to Perl's internal representation like so:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">sub my_escape_html ($) {
    my($what) = shift;
    return unless defined $what;
    Encode::decode_utf8(Foo::Bar::escape_html(
                                     Encode::encode_utf8($what)));
}
</pre>
<p>Sometimes, when the extension does not convert data but just stores and retrieves it, you will be able to use the otherwise dangerous <a href="encode#_utf8_on">Encode::_utf8_on() </a> function. Let's say the popular <code class="inline"><span class="w">Foo::Bar</span></code> extension, written in C, provides a <code class="inline"><span class="w">param</span></code> method that lets you store and retrieve data according to these prototypes:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">$self-&gt;param($name, $value);            # set a scalar
$value = $self-&gt;param($name);           # retrieve a scalar
</pre>
<p>If it does not yet provide support for any encoding, one could write a derived class with such a <code class="inline"><span class="w">param</span></code> method:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">sub param {
  my($self,$name,$value) = @_;
  utf8::upgrade($name);     # make sure it is UTF-8 encoded
  if (defined $value) {
    utf8::upgrade($value);  # make sure it is UTF-8 encoded
    return $self-&gt;SUPER::param($name,$value);
  } else {
    my $ret = $self-&gt;SUPER::param($name);
    Encode::_utf8_on($ret); # we know, it is UTF-8 encoded
    return $ret;
  }
}
</pre>
<p>Some extensions provide filters on data entry/exit points, such as <code class="inline"><span class="w">DB_File::filter_store_key</span></code> and family. Look out for such filters in the documentation of your extensions; they can make the transition to Unicode data much easier.</p> <h3 id="Speed">Speed</h3> <p>Some functions are slower when working on UTF-8 encoded strings than on byte encoded strings. All functions that need to hop over characters such as <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/length">length()</a></code>, <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/substr">substr()</a></code> or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/index">index()</a></code>, or matching regular expressions can work <b>much</b> faster when the underlying data are byte-encoded.</p> <p>In Perl 5.8.0 the slowness was often quite spectacular; in Perl 5.8.1 a caching scheme was introduced which improved the situation. In general, operations with UTF-8 encoded strings are still slower. As an example, the Unicode properties (character classes) like <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">Nd</span><span class="s">}</span></code> are known to be quite a bit slower (5-20 times) than their simpler counterparts like <code class="inline"><span class="s">[</span><span class="n">0</span>-<span class="n">9</span><span class="s">]</span></code> (then again, there are hundreds of Unicode characters matching <code class="inline"><span class="w">Nd</span></code> compared with the 10 ASCII characters matching <code class="inline"><span class="s">[</span><span class="n">0</span>-<span class="n">9</span><span class="s">]</span></code> ).</p> <h2 id="SEE-ALSO">SEE ALSO</h2> <p><a href="perlunitut">perlunitut</a>, <a href="perluniintro">perluniintro</a>, <a href="perluniprops">perluniprops</a>, <a href="encode">Encode</a>, <a href="open">open</a>, <a href="utf8">utf8</a>, <a href="bytes">bytes</a>, <a href="perlretut">perlretut</a>, <a href="perlvar#%24%7b%5eUNICODE%7d">${^UNICODE} in perlvar</a>, <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44">http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44</a>).</p>
