(An interactive Perl environment is also possible--see <a href="perldebug">perldebug</a> for details on how to do that.) Upon startup, Perl looks for your program in one of the following places:</p> <dl> <dt>1.</dt>
<dd> <p>Specified line by line via <b>-e</b> or <b>-E</b> switches on the command line.</p> </dd> <dt>2.</dt>
<dd> <p>Contained in the file specified by the first filename on the command line. (Note that systems supporting the <code class="inline"><span class="c">#!</span></code> notation invoke interpreters this way. See <a href="#Location-of-Perl">Location of Perl</a>.)</p> </dd> <dt>3.</dt>
<dd> <p>Passed in implicitly via standard input. This works only if there are no filename arguments--to pass arguments to a STDIN-read program you must explicitly specify a "-" for the program name.</p> </dd> </dl> <p>With methods 2 and 3, Perl starts parsing the input file from the beginning, unless you've specified a <b>-x</b> switch, in which case it scans for the first line starting with <code class="inline"><span class="c">#!</span></code> and containing the word "perl", and starts there instead. This is useful for running a program embedded in a larger message. (In this case you would indicate the end of the program using the <code class="inline">__END__</code> token.)</p> <p>The <code class="inline"><span class="c">#!</span></code> line is always examined for switches as the line is being parsed. Thus, if you're on a machine that allows only one argument with the <code class="inline"><span class="c">#!</span></code> line, or worse, doesn't even recognize the <code class="inline"><span class="c">#!</span></code> line, you still can get consistent switch behaviour regardless of how Perl was invoked, even if <b>-x</b> was used to find the beginning of the program.</p> <p>Because historically some operating systems silently chopped off kernel interpretation of the <code class="inline"><span class="c">#!</span></code> line after 32 characters, some switches may be passed in on the command line, and some may not; you could even get a "-" without its letter, if you're not careful. You probably want to make sure that all your switches fall either before or after that 32-character boundary. Most switches don't actually care if they're processed redundantly, but getting a "-" instead of a complete switch could cause Perl to try to execute standard input instead of your program. And a partial <b>-I</b> switch could also cause odd results.</p> <p>Some switches do care if they are processed twice, for instance combinations of <b>-l</b> and <b>-0</b>. Either put all the switches after the 32-character boundary (if applicable), or replace the use of <b>-0</b><i>digits</i> by <code class="inline">BEGIN<span class="s">{</span> <span class="i">$/</span> = <span class="q">"\0digits"</span><span class="sc">;</span> <span class="s">}</span></code> .</p> <p>Parsing of the <code class="inline"><span class="c">#!</span></code> switches starts wherever "perl" is mentioned in the line. The sequences "-*" and "- " are specifically ignored so that you could, if you were so inclined, say</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">#!/bin/sh
#! -*-perl-*-
eval 'exec perl -x -wS $0 ${1+"$@"}'
    if 0;
</pre>
<p>to let Perl see the <b>-p</b> switch.</p> <p>A similar trick involves the <i>env</i> program, if you have it.</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">#!/usr/bin/env perl
</pre>
<p>The examples above use a relative path to the perl interpreter, getting whatever version is first in the user's path. If you want a specific version of Perl, say, perl5.14.1, you should place that directly in the <code class="inline"><span class="c">#!</span></code> line's path.</p> <p>If the <code class="inline"><span class="c">#!</span></code> line does not contain the word "perl" nor the word "indir" the program named after the <code class="inline"><span class="c">#!</span></code> is executed instead of the Perl interpreter. This is slightly bizarre, but it helps people on machines that don't do <code class="inline"><span class="c">#!</span></code> , because they can tell a program that their SHELL is <i>/usr/bin/perl</i>, and Perl will then dispatch the program to the correct interpreter for them.</p> <p>After locating your program, Perl compiles the entire program to an internal form. If there are any compilation errors, execution of the program is not attempted. (This is unlike the typical shell script, which might run part-way through before finding a syntax error.)</p> <p>If the program is syntactically correct, it is executed. If the program runs off the end without hitting an exit() or die() operator, an implicit <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/exit">exit(0)</a></code> is provided to indicate successful completion.</p> <h3 id="%23!-and-quoting-on-non-Unix-systems">#! and quoting on non-Unix systems </h3> <p>Unix's <code class="inline"><span class="c">#!</span></code> technique can be simulated on other systems:</p> <ul> <li id="OS%2f2">
<b>OS/2</b> <p>Put</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">extproc perl -S -your_switches
</pre>
<p>as the first line in <code class="inline">*.cmd</code> file (<b>-S</b> due to a bug in cmd.exe's `extproc' handling).</p> </li> <li id="MS-DOS">
<b>MS-DOS</b> <p>Create a batch file to run your program, and codify it in <code class="inline"><span class="w">ALTERNATE_SHEBANG</span></code> (see the <i>dosish.h</i> file in the source distribution for more information).</p> </li> <li id="Win95%2fNT">
<b>Win95/NT</b> <p>The Win95/NT installation, when using the ActiveState installer for Perl, will modify the Registry to associate the <i>.pl</i> extension with the perl interpreter. If you install Perl by other means (including building from the sources), you may have to modify the Registry yourself. Note that this means you can no longer tell the difference between an executable Perl program and a Perl library file.</p> </li> <li id="VMS">
<b>VMS</b> <p>Put</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">$ perl -mysw 'f$env("procedure")' 'p1' 'p2' 'p3' 'p4' 'p5' 'p6' 'p7' 'p8' !
$ exit++ + ++$status != 0 and $exit = $status = undef;
</pre>
<p>at the top of your program, where <b>-mysw</b> are any command line switches you want to pass to Perl. You can now invoke the program directly, by saying <code class="inline"><span class="w">perl</span> <span class="w">program</span></code> , or as a DCL procedure, by saying <code class="inline"><span class="i">@program</span></code> (or implicitly via <i>DCL$PATH</i> by just using the name of the program).</p> <p>This incantation is a bit much to remember, but Perl will display it for you if you say <code class="inline"><span class="w">perl</span> <span class="q">"-V:startperl"</span></code> .</p> </li> </ul> <p>Command-interpreters on non-Unix systems have rather different ideas on quoting than Unix shells. You'll need to learn the special characters in your command-interpreter (<code class="inline"><span class="i">*</span></code> , <code class="inline">\</code> and <code class="inline">"</code> are common) and how to protect whitespace and these characters to run one-liners (see <a href="#-e-commandline">-e</a> below).</p> <p>On some systems, you may have to change single-quotes to double ones, which you must <i>not</i> do on Unix or Plan 9 systems. You might also have to change a single % to a %%.</p> <p>For example:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl"># Unix
perl -e 'print "Hello world\n"'

# MS-DOS, etc.
perl -e "print \"Hello world\n\""

# VMS
perl -e "print ""Hello world\n"""
</pre>
<p>The problem is that none of this is reliable: it depends on the command and it is entirely possible neither works. If <i>4DOS</i> were the command shell, this would probably work better:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">perl -e "print &lt;Ctrl-x&gt;"Hello world\n&lt;Ctrl-x&gt;""
</pre>
<p><b>CMD.EXE</b> in Windows NT slipped a lot of standard Unix functionality in when nobody was looking, but just try to find documentation for its quoting rules.</p> <p>There is no general solution to all of this. It's just a mess.</p> <h3 id="Location-of-Perl">Location of Perl </h3> <p>It may seem obvious to say, but Perl is useful only when users can easily find it. When possible, it's good for both <i>/usr/bin/perl</i> and <i>/usr/local/bin/perl</i> to be symlinks to the actual binary. If that can't be done, system administrators are strongly encouraged to put (symlinks to) perl and its accompanying utilities into a directory typically found along a user's PATH, or in some other obvious and convenient place.</p> <p>In this documentation, <code class="inline">#!/usr/bin/perl</code> on the first line of the program will stand in for whatever method works on your system. You are advised to use a specific path if you care about a specific version.</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">#!/usr/local/bin/perl5.14
</pre>
<p>or if you just want to be running at least version, place a statement like this at the top of your program:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">use 5.014;
</pre>
<h3 id="Command-Switches">Command Switches </h3> <p>As with all standard commands, a single-character switch may be clustered with the following switch, if any.</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">#!/usr/bin/perl -spi.orig	# same as -s -p -i.orig
</pre>
<p>A <code class="inline">--</code> signals the end of options and disables further option processing. Any arguments after the <code class="inline">--</code> are treated as filenames and arguments.</p> <p>Switches include:</p> <ul> <li id="*-0*%5b_octal%2fhexadecimal_%5d">
<b><b>-0</b>[<i>octal/hexadecimal</i>] </b> <p>specifies the input record separator (<code class="inline"><span class="i">$/</span></code> ) as an octal or hexadecimal number. If there are no digits, the null character is the separator. Other switches may precede or follow the digits. For example, if you have a version of <i>find</i> which can print filenames terminated by the null character, you can say this:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">find . -name '*.orig' -print0 | perl -n0e unlink
</pre>
<p>The special value 00 will cause Perl to slurp files in paragraph mode. Any value 0400 or above will cause Perl to slurp files whole, but by convention the value 0777 is the one normally used for this purpose.</p> <p>You can also specify the separator character using hexadecimal notation: <b>-0x<i>HHH...</i></b>, where the <code class="inline"><i>H</i></code> are valid hexadecimal digits. Unlike the octal form, this one may be used to specify any Unicode character, even those beyond 0xFF. So if you <i>really</i> want a record separator of 0777, specify it as <b>-0x1FF</b>. (This means that you cannot use the <b>-x</b> option with a directory name that consists of hexadecimal digits, or else Perl will think you have specified a hex number to <b>-0</b>.)</p> </li> <li id="*-a*">
<b><b>-a</b> </b> <p>turns on autosplit mode when used with a <b>-n</b> or <b>-p</b>. An implicit split command to the @F array is done as the first thing inside the implicit while loop produced by the <b>-n</b> or <b>-p</b>.</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">perl -ane 'print pop(@F), "\n";'
</pre>
<p>is equivalent to</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">    while (&lt;&gt;) {
@F = split(' ');
print pop(@F), "\n";
    }
</pre>
<p>An alternate delimiter may be specified using <b>-F</b>.</p> <p><b>-a</b> implicitly sets <b>-n</b>.</p> </li> <li id="*-C-%5b_number%2flist_%5d*">
<b><b>-C [<i>number/list</i>]</b> </b> <p>The <b>-C</b> flag controls some of the Perl Unicode features.</p> <p>As of 5.8.1, the <b>-C</b> can be followed either by a number or a list of option letters. The letters, their numeric values, and effects are as follows; listing the letters is equal to summing the numbers.</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">I     1   STDIN is assumed to be in UTF-8
O     2   STDOUT will be in UTF-8
E     4   STDERR will be in UTF-8
S     7   I + O + E
i     8   UTF-8 is the default PerlIO layer for input streams
o    16   UTF-8 is the default PerlIO layer for output streams
D    24   i + o
A    32   the @ARGV elements are expected to be strings encoded
          in UTF-8
L    64   normally the "IOEioA" are unconditional, the L makes
          them conditional on the locale environment variables
          (the LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, and LANG, in the order of
          decreasing precedence) -- if the variables indicate
          UTF-8, then the selected "IOEioA" are in effect
a   256   Set ${^UTF8CACHE} to -1, to run the UTF-8 caching
          code in debugging mode.
</pre>
<p>For example, <b>-COE</b> and <b>-C6</b> will both turn on UTF-8-ness on both STDOUT and STDERR. Repeating letters is just redundant, not cumulative nor toggling.</p> <p>The <code class="inline"><span class="w">io</span></code> options mean that any subsequent open() (or similar I/O operations) in the current file scope will have the <code class="inline"><span class="j">:</span><span class="w">utf8</span></code> PerlIO layer implicitly applied to them, in other words, UTF-8 is expected from any input stream, and UTF-8 is produced to any output stream. This is just the default, with explicit layers in open() and with binmode() one can manipulate streams as usual.</p> <p><b>-C</b> on its own (not followed by any number or option list), or the empty string <code class="inline"><span class="q">""</span></code> for the <code class="inline"><span class="w">PERL_UNICODE</span></code> environment variable, has the same effect as <b>-CSDL</b>. In other words, the standard I/O handles and the default <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/open">open()</a></code> layer are UTF-8-fied <i>but</i> only if the locale environment variables indicate a UTF-8 locale. This behaviour follows the <i>implicit</i> (and problematic) UTF-8 behaviour of Perl 5.8.0. (See <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/5.26.0/perl581delta.html#UTF-8-no-longer-default-under-UTF-8-locales">UTF-8 no longer default under UTF-8 locales in perl581delta</a>.)</p> <p>You can use <b>-C0</b> (or <code class="inline"><span class="q">"0"</span></code> for <code class="inline"><span class="w">PERL_UNICODE</span></code> ) to explicitly disable all the above Unicode features.</p> <p>The read-only magic variable <code class="inline"><span class="i">$</span>{<span class="w">^UNICODE</span>}</code> reflects the numeric value of this setting. This variable is set during Perl startup and is thereafter read-only. If you want runtime effects, use the three-arg open() (see <a href="functions/open">open</a>), the two-arg binmode() (see <a href="functions/binmode">binmode</a>), and the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/open">open</a></code> pragma (see <a href="open">open</a>).</p> <p>(In Perls earlier than 5.8.1 the <b>-C</b> switch was a Win32-only switch that enabled the use of Unicode-aware "wide system call" Win32 APIs. This feature was practically unused, however, and the command line switch was therefore "recycled".)</p> <p><b>Note:</b> Since perl 5.10.1, if the <b>-C</b> option is used on the <code class="inline"><span class="c">#!</span></code> line, it must be specified on the command line as well, since the standard streams are already set up at this point in the execution of the perl interpreter. You can also use binmode() to set the encoding of an I/O stream.</p> </li> <li id="*-c*">
<b><b>-c</b> </b> <p>causes Perl to check the syntax of the program and then exit without executing it. Actually, it <i>will</i> execute and <code class="inline">BEGIN</code> , <code class="inline">UNITCHECK</code> , or <code class="inline">CHECK</code> blocks and any <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use">use</a></code> statements: these are considered as occurring outside the execution of your program. <code class="inline">INIT</code> and <code class="inline">END</code> blocks, however, will be skipped.</p> </li> <li id="*-d*">

<b><b>-dt:</b><i>MOD[=bar,baz]</i></b> <p>runs the program under the control of a debugging, profiling, or tracing module installed as <code class="inline">Devel::<i>MOD</i></code>. E.g., <b>-d:DProf</b> executes the program using the <code class="inline"><span class="w">Devel::DProf</span></code> profiler. As with the <b>-M</b> flag, options may be passed to the <code class="inline">Devel::<i>MOD</i></code> package where they will be received and interpreted by the <code class="inline">Devel::<i>MOD</i>::import</code> routine. Again, like <b>-M</b>, use -<b>-d:-<i>MOD</i></b> to call <code class="inline">Devel::<i>MOD</i>::unimport</code> instead of import. The comma-separated list of options must follow a <code class="inline">=</code> character. If <b>t</b> is specified, it indicates to the debugger that threads will be used in the code being debugged.

<b><b>-i</b>[<i>extension</i>] </b> <p>specifies that files processed by the <code class="inline">&lt;&gt;</code> construct are to be edited in-place. It does this by renaming the input file, opening the output file by the original name, and selecting that output file as the default for print() statements. The extension, if supplied, is used to modify the name of the old file to make a backup copy, following these rules:</p> <p>If no extension is supplied, and your system supports it, the original <i>file</i> is kept open without a name while the output is redirected to a new file with the original <i>filename</i>. When perl exits, cleanly or not, the original <i>file</i> is unlinked.</p> <p>If the extension doesn't contain a <code class="inline"><span class="i">*</span></code> , then it is appended to the end of the current filename as a suffix. If the extension does contain one or more <code class="inline"><span class="i">*</span></code> characters, then each <code class="inline"><span class="i">*</span></code> is replaced with the current filename. In Perl terms, you could think of this as:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">($backup = $extension) =~ s/\*/$file_name/g;
</pre>
<p>This allows you to add a prefix to the backup file, instead of (or in addition to) a suffix:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">$ perl -pi'orig_*' -e 's/bar/baz/' fileA  # backup to
                                                                                     # 'orig_fileA'
</pre>
<p>Or even to place backup copies of the original files into another directory (provided the directory already exists):</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">$ perl -pi'old/*.orig' -e 's/bar/baz/' fileA  # backup to
                                                                                             # 'old/fileA.orig'
</pre>
<p>These sets of one-liners are equivalent:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">$ perl -pi -e 's/bar/baz/' fileA          # overwrite current file
$ perl -pi'*' -e 's/bar/baz/' fileA       # overwrite current file

$ perl -pi'.orig' -e 's/bar/baz/' fileA   # backup to 'fileA.orig'
$ perl -pi'*.orig' -e 's/bar/baz/' fileA  # backup to 'fileA.orig'
</pre>
<p>From the shell, saying</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">$ perl -p -i.orig -e "s/foo/bar/; ... "
</pre>
<p>is the same as using the program:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">#!/usr/bin/perl -pi.orig
s/foo/bar/;
</pre>
<p>which is equivalent to</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">    #!/usr/bin/perl

    LINE: while (&lt;&gt;) {
if ($ARGV ne $oldargv) {
    if ($extension !~ /\*/) {

    else {

<p>except that the <b>-i</b> form doesn't need to compare $ARGV to $oldargv to know when the filename has changed. It does, however, use ARGVOUT for the selected filehandle. Note that STDOUT is restored as the default output filehandle after the loop.</p> <p>As shown above, Perl creates the backup file whether or not any output is actually changed. So this is just a fancy way to copy files:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">    $ perl -p -i'/some/file/path/*' -e 1 file1 file2 file3...
or
    $ perl -p -i'.orig' -e 1 file1 file2 file3...

<p>You can use <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/eof">eof</a></code> without parentheses to locate the end of each input file, in case you want to append to each file, or reset line numbering (see example in <a href="functions/eof">eof</a>).</p> <p>If, for a given file, Perl is unable to create the backup file as specified in the extension then it will skip that file and continue on with the next one (if it exists).</p> <p>For a discussion of issues surrounding file permissions and <b>-i</b>, see <a href="perlfaq5#Why-does-Perl-let-me-delete-read-only-files%3f-Why-does--i-clobber-protected-files%3f-Isn't-this-a-bug-in-Perl%3f">Why does Perl let me delete read-only files? Why does -i clobber protected files? Isn't this a bug in Perl? in perlfaq5</a>.</p> <p>You cannot use <b>-i</b> to create directories or to strip extensions from files.</p> <p>Perl does not expand <code class="inline">~</code> in filenames, which is good, since some folks use it for their backup files:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">$ perl -pi~ -e 's/foo/bar/' file1 file2 file3...
</pre>
<p>Note that because <b>-i</b> renames or deletes the original file before creating a new file of the same name, Unix-style soft and hard links will not be preserved.</p> <p>Finally, the <b>-i</b> switch does not impede execution when no files are given on the command line. In this case, no backup is made (the original file cannot, of course, be determined) and processing proceeds from STDIN to STDOUT as might be expected.</p> </li> <li id="*-I*_directory_">

<b><b>-l</b>[<i>octnum</i>] </b> <p>enables automatic line-ending processing. It has two separate effects. First, it automatically chomps <code class="inline"><span class="i">$/</span></code> (the input record separator) when used with <b>-n</b> or <b>-p</b>. Second, it assigns <code class="inline"><span class="i">$\</span></code> (the output record separator) to have the value of <i>octnum</i> so that any print statements will have that separator added back on. If <i>octnum</i> is omitted, sets <code class="inline"><span class="i">$\</span></code> to the current value of <code class="inline"><span class="i">$/</span></code> . For instance, to trim lines to 80 columns:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">perl -lpe 'substr($_, 80) = ""'
</pre>
<p>Note that the assignment <code class="inline"><span class="i">$\</span> = <span class="i">$/</span></code> is done when the switch is processed, so the input record separator can be different than the output record separator if the <b>-l</b> switch is followed by a <b>-0</b> switch:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">gnufind / -print0 | perl -ln0e 'print "found $_" if -p'

<b><b>-n</b> </b> <p>causes Perl to assume the following loop around your program, which makes it iterate over filename arguments somewhat like <i>sed -n</i> or <i>awk</i>:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">  LINE:
    while (&lt;&gt;) {
...		# your program goes here
    }
</pre>
<p>Note that the lines are not printed by default. See <a href="#-p">-p</a> to have lines printed. If a file named by an argument cannot be opened for some reason, Perl warns you about it and moves on to the next file.</p> <p>Also note that <code class="inline">&lt;&gt;</code> passes command line arguments to <a href="functions/open">open</a>, which doesn't necessarily interpret them as file names. See <a href="perlop">perlop</a> for possible security implications.</p> <p>Here is an efficient way to delete all files that haven't been modified for at least a week:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">find . -mtime +7 -print | perl -nle unlink
</pre>
<p>This is faster than using the <b>-exec</b> switch of <i>find</i> because you don't have to start a process on every filename found. It does suffer from the bug of mishandling newlines in pathnames, which you can fix if you follow the example under <b>-0</b>.</p> <p><code class="inline">BEGIN</code> and <code class="inline">END</code> blocks may be used to capture control before or after the implicit program loop, just as in <i>awk</i>.</p> </li> <li id="*-p*">

<p>If a file named by an argument cannot be opened for some reason, Perl warns you about it, and moves on to the next file. Note that the lines are printed automatically. An error occurring during printing is treated as fatal. To suppress printing use the <b>-n</b> switch. A <b>-p</b> overrides a <b>-n</b> switch.</p> <p><code class="inline">BEGIN</code> and <code class="inline">END</code> blocks may be used to capture control before or after the implicit loop, just as in <i>awk</i>.</p> </li> <li id="*-s*">
<b><b>-s</b> </b> <p>enables rudimentary switch parsing for switches on the command line after the program name but before any filename arguments (or before an argument of <b>--</b>). Any switch found there is removed from @ARGV and sets the corresponding variable in the Perl program. The following program prints "1" if the program is invoked with a <b>-xyz</b> switch, and "abc" if it is invoked with <b>-xyz=abc</b>.</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">#!/usr/bin/perl -s
if ($xyz) { print "$xyz\n" }

<p>Do note that a switch like <b>--help</b> creates the variable <code class="inline"><span class="i">$</span>{-<span class="w">help</span>}</code> , which is not compliant with <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use">use</a> <span class="w">strict</span> <span class="q">"refs"</span></code> . Also, when using this option on a script with warnings enabled you may get a lot of spurious "used only once" warnings.</p> </li> <li id="*-S*">
<b><b>-S</b> </b> <p>makes Perl use the PATH environment variable to search for the program unless the name of the program contains path separators.</p> <p>On some platforms, this also makes Perl append suffixes to the filename while searching for it. For example, on Win32 platforms, the ".bat" and ".cmd" suffixes are appended if a lookup for the original name fails, and if the name does not already end in one of those suffixes. If your Perl was compiled with <code class="inline"><span class="w">DEBUGGING</span></code> turned on, using the <b>-Dp</b> switch to Perl shows how the search progresses.</p> <p>Typically this is used to emulate <code class="inline"><span class="c">#!</span></code> startup on platforms that don't support <code class="inline"><span class="c">#!</span></code> . It's also convenient when debugging a script that uses <code class="inline"><span class="c">#!</span></code> , and is thus normally found by the shell's $PATH search mechanism.</p> <p>This example works on many platforms that have a shell compatible with Bourne shell:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">    #!/usr/bin/perl
    eval 'exec /usr/bin/perl -wS $0 ${1+"$@"}'
if $running_under_some_shell;
</pre>
<p>The system ignores the first line and feeds the program to <i>/bin/sh</i>, which proceeds to try to execute the Perl program as a shell script. The shell executes the second line as a normal shell command, and thus starts up the Perl interpreter. On some systems $0 doesn't always contain the full pathname, so the <b>-S</b> tells Perl to search for the program if necessary. After Perl locates the program, it parses the lines and ignores them because the variable $running_under_some_shell is never true. If the program will be interpreted by csh, you will need to replace <code class="inline"><span class="i">$</span>{<span class="n">1</span>+<span class="q">"$@"</span>}</code> with <code class="inline"><span class="i">$*</span></code> , even though that doesn't understand embedded spaces (and such) in the argument list. To start up <i>sh</i> rather than <i>csh</i>, some systems may have to replace the <code class="inline"><span class="c">#!</span></code> line with a line containing just a colon, which will be politely ignored by Perl. Other systems can't control that, and need a totally devious construct that will work under any of <i>csh</i>, <i>sh</i>, or Perl, such as the following:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">eval '(exit $?0)' &amp;&amp; eval 'exec perl -wS $0 ${1+"$@"}'
&amp; eval 'exec /usr/bin/perl -wS $0 $argv:q'
	if $running_under_some_shell;
</pre>
<p>If the filename supplied contains directory separators (and so is an absolute or relative pathname), and if that file is not found, platforms that append file extensions will do so and try to look for the file with those extensions added, one by one.</p> <p>On DOS-like platforms, if the program does not contain directory separators, it will first be searched for in the current directory before being searched for on the PATH. On Unix platforms, the program will be searched for strictly on the PATH.</p> </li> <li id="*-t*">
<b><b>-t</b> </b> <p>Like <b>-T</b>, but taint checks will issue warnings rather than fatal errors. These warnings can now be controlled normally with <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/no">no</a> <span class="w">warnings</span>
<span class="q">qw(taint)</span></code> .</p> <p><b>Note: This is not a substitute for <code class="inline">-T</code> !</b> This is meant to be used <i>only</i> as a temporary development aid while securing legacy code: for real production code and for new secure code written from scratch, always use the real <b>-T</b>.</p> </li> <li id="*-T*">
<b><b>-T</b> </b> <p>turns on "taint" so you can test them. Ordinarily these checks are done only when running setuid or setgid. It's a good idea to turn them on explicitly for programs that run on behalf of someone else whom you might not necessarily trust, such as CGI programs or any internet servers you might write in Perl. See <a href="perlsec">perlsec</a> for details. For security reasons, this option must be seen by Perl quite early; usually this means it must appear early on the command line or in the <code class="inline"><span class="c">#!</span></code> line for systems which support that construct.</p> </li> <li id="*-u*">
<b><b>-u</b> </b> <p>This switch causes Perl to dump core after compiling your program. You can then in theory take this core dump and turn it into an executable file by using the <i>undump</i> program (not supplied). This speeds startup at the expense of some disk space (which you can minimize by stripping the executable). (Still, a "hello world" executable comes out to about 200K on my machine.) If you want to execute a portion of your program before dumping, use the dump() operator instead. Note: availability of <i>undump</i> is platform specific and may not be available for a specific port of Perl.</p> </li> <li id="*-U*">
<b><b>-U</b> </b> <p>allows Perl to do unsafe operations.

<b>PERL5LIB </b> <p>A list of directories in which to look for Perl library files before looking in the standard library and the current directory. Any architecture-specific and version-specific directories, such as <i>version/archname/</i>, <i>version/</i>, or <i>archname/</i> under the specified locations are automatically included if they exist, with this lookup done at interpreter startup time. In addition, any directories matching the entries in <code class="inline"><span class="i">$Config</span>{<span class="w">inc_version_list</span>}</code> are added. (These typically would be for older compatible perl versions installed in the same directory tree.)</p> <p>If PERL5LIB is not defined, PERLLIB is used. Directories are separated (like in PATH) by a colon on Unixish platforms and by a semicolon on Windows (the proper path separator being given by the command <code class="inline">perl
-V:<i>path_sep</i></code>).</p> <p>When running taint checks, either because the program was running setuid or setgid, or the <b>-T</b> or <b>-t</b> switch was specified, neither PERL5LIB nor PERLLIB is consulted. The program should instead say:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">use lib "/my/directory";
</pre>
</li> <li id="PERL5OPT">
<b>PERL5OPT </b> <p>Command-line options (switches). Switches in this variable are treated as if they were on every Perl command line. Only the <b>-[CDIMUdmtwW]</b> switches are allowed. When running taint checks (either because the program was running setuid or setgid, or because the <b>-T</b> or <b>-t</b> switch was used), this variable is ignored. If PERL5OPT begins with <b>-T</b>, tainting will be enabled and subsequent options ignored. If PERL5OPT begins with <b>-t</b>, tainting will be enabled, a writable dot removed from @INC, and subsequent options honored.</p> </li> <li id="PERLIO">
<b>PERLIO </b> <p>A space (or colon) separated list of PerlIO layers. If perl is built to use PerlIO system for IO (the default) these layers affect Perl's IO.</p> <p>It is conventional to start layer names with a colon (for example, <code class="inline"><span class="j">:</span><span class="w">perlio</span></code> ) to emphasize their similarity to variable "attributes". But the code that parses layer specification strings, which is also used to decode the PERLIO environment variable, treats the colon as a separator.</p> <p>An unset or empty PERLIO is equivalent to the default set of layers for your platform; for example, <code class="inline">:unix:perlio</code> on Unix-like systems and <code class="inline">:unix:crlf</code> on Windows and other DOS-like systems.</p> <p>The list becomes the default for <i>all</i> Perl's IO. Consequently only built-in layers can appear in this list, as external layers (such as <code class="inline"><span class="j">:</span><span class="i">encoding</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code> ) need IO in order to load them! See <a href="open">open pragma</a> for how to add external encodings as defaults.</p> <p>Layers it makes sense to include in the PERLIO environment variable are briefly summarized below. For more details see <a href="perlio">PerlIO</a>.</p> <ul> <li id="%3abytes">
<b>:bytes </b> <p>A pseudolayer that turns the <code class="inline"><span class="j">:</span><span class="w">utf8</span></code> flag <i>off</i> for the layer below; unlikely to be useful on its own in the global PERLIO environment variable. You perhaps were thinking of <code class="inline">:crlf:bytes</code> or <code class="inline">:perlio:bytes</code>.</p> </li> <li id="%3acrlf">
<b>:crlf </b> <p>A layer which does CRLF to <code class="inline"><span class="q">"\n"</span></code> translation distinguishing "text" and "binary" files in the manner of MS-DOS and similar operating systems. (It currently does <i>not</i> mimic MS-DOS as far as treating of Control-Z as being an end-of-file marker.)</p> </li> <li id="%3ammap">
<b>:mmap </b> <p>A layer that implements "reading" of files by using <i>mmap</i>(2) to make an entire file appear in the process's address space, and then using that as PerlIO's "buffer".</p> </li> <li id="%3aperlio">
<b>:perlio </b> <p>This is a re-implementation of stdio-like buffering written as a PerlIO layer. As such it will call whatever layer is below it for its operations, typically <code class="inline"><span class="j">:</span><span class="w">unix</span></code> .</p> </li> <li id="%3apop">
<b>:pop </b> <p>An experimental pseudolayer that removes the topmost layer. Use with the same care as is reserved for nitroglycerine.</p> </li> <li id="%3araw">
<b>:raw </b> <p>A pseudolayer that manipulates other layers. Applying the <code class="inline"><span class="j">:</span><span class="w">raw</span></code> layer is equivalent to calling <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/binmode">binmode($fh)</a></code>. It makes the stream pass each byte as-is without translation. In particular, both CRLF translation and intuiting <code class="inline"><span class="j">:</span><span class="w">utf8</span></code> from the locale are disabled.</p> <p>Unlike in earlier versions of Perl, <code class="inline"><span class="j">:</span><span class="w">raw</span></code> is <i>not</i> just the inverse of <code class="inline"><span class="j">:</span><span class="w">crlf</span></code> : other layers which would affect the binary nature of the stream are also removed or disabled.</p> </li> <li id="%3astdio">
<b>:stdio </b> <p>This layer provides a PerlIO interface by wrapping system's ANSI C "stdio" library calls. The layer provides both buffering and IO. Note that the <code class="inline"><span class="j">:</span><span class="w">stdio</span></code> layer does <i>not</i> do CRLF translation even if that is the platform's normal behaviour. You will need a <code class="inline"><span class="j">:</span><span class="w">crlf</span></code> layer above it to do that.</p> </li> <li id="%3aunix">
<b>:unix </b> <p>Low-level layer that calls <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/read">read</a></code>, <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/write">write</a></code>, <code class="inline"><span class="w">lseek</span></code> , etc.</p> </li> <li id="%3autf8">
<b>:utf8 </b> <p>A pseudolayer that enables a flag in the layer below to tell Perl that output should be in utf8 and that input should be regarded as already in valid utf8 form. <b>WARNING: It does not check for validity and as such should be handled with extreme caution for input, because security violations can occur with non-shortest UTF-8 encodings, etc.</b> Generally <code class="inline"><span class="j">:</span><span class="i">encoding</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="w">utf8</span><span class="s">)</span></code> is the best option when reading UTF-8 encoded data.</p> </li> <li id="%3awin32">
<b>:win32 </b> <p>On Win32 platforms this <i>experimental</i> layer uses native "handle" IO rather than a Unix-like numeric file descriptor layer. Known to be buggy in this release (5.14).</p> </li> </ul> <p>The default set of layers should give acceptable results on all platforms</p> <p>For Unix platforms that will be the equivalent of "unix perlio" or "stdio". Configure is set up to prefer the "stdio" implementation if the system's library provides for fast access to the buffer; otherwise, it uses the "unix perlio" implementation.</p> <p>On Win32 the default in this release (5.14) is "unix crlf". Win32's "stdio" has a number of bugs/mis-features for Perl IO which are somewhat depending on the version and vendor of the C compiler. Using our own <code class="inline"><span class="w">crlf</span></code> layer as the buffer avoids those issues and makes things more uniform. The <code class="inline"><span class="w">crlf</span></code> layer provides CRLF conversion as well as buffering.</p> <p>This release (5.14) uses <code class="inline"><span class="w">unix</span></code> as the bottom layer on Win32, and so still uses the C compiler's numeric file descriptor routines. There is an experimental native <code class="inline"><span class="w">win32</span></code> layer, which is expected to be enhanced and should eventually become the default under Win32.</p> <p>The PERLIO environment variable is completely ignored when Perl is run in taint mode.</p> </li> <li id="PERLIO_DEBUG">
<b>PERLIO_DEBUG </b> <p>If set to the name of a file or device, certain operations of PerlIO subsystem will be logged to that file, which is opened in append mode. Typical uses are in Unix:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">% env PERLIO_DEBUG=/dev/tty perl script ...

Precede any character that needs to be protected, like a space or backslash, with another backslash.</p> <p>Note that Perl doesn't use COMSPEC for this purpose because COMSPEC has a high degree of variability among users, leading to portability concerns. Besides, Perl can use a shell that may not be fit for interactive use, and setting COMSPEC to such a shell may interfere with the proper functioning of other programs (which usually look in COMSPEC to find a shell fit for interactive use).</p> <p>Before Perl 5.10.0 and 5.8.8, PERL5SHELL was not taint checked when running external commands.

However, this may cause problems if you have a firewall such as <i>McAfee Guardian</i>, which requires that all applications use its LSP but which is not IFS-compatible, because clearly Perl will normally avoid using such an LSP.</p> <p>Setting this environment variable to 1 means that Perl will simply use the first suitable LSP enumerated in the catalog, which keeps <i>McAfee Guardian</i> happy--and in that particular case Perl still works too because <i>McAfee Guardian</i>'s LSP actually plays other games which allow applications requiring IFS compatibility to work.</p> </li> <li id="PERL_DEBUG_MSTATS">
