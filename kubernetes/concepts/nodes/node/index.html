<h1>Nodes</h1>  <p>Kubernetes runs your workload by placing containers into Pods to run on <em>Nodes</em>. A node may be a virtual or physical machine, depending on the cluster. Each node is managed by the <a class="glossary-tooltip" title="The container orchestration layer that exposes the API and interfaces to define, deploy, and manage the lifecycle of containers." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/glossary/?all=true#term-control-plane" target="_blank" aria-label="control plane">control plane</a> and contains the services necessary to run <a class="glossary-tooltip" title="A Pod represents a set of running containers in your cluster." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../../workloads/pods/index" target="_blank" aria-label="Pods">Pods</a>.</p> <p>Typically you have several nodes in a cluster; in a learning or resource-limited environment, you might have only one node.</p> <p>The <a href="../../overview/components/index#node-components">components</a> on a node include the <a class="glossary-tooltip" title="An agent that runs on each node in the cluster. It makes sure that containers are running in a pod." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../../../reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet/index" target="_blank" aria-label="kubelet">kubelet</a>, a <a class="glossary-tooltip" title="The container runtime is the software that is responsible for running containers." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../../../setup/production-environment/container-runtimes/index" target="_blank" aria-label="container runtime">container runtime</a>, and the <a class="glossary-tooltip" title="kube-proxy is a network proxy that runs on each node in the cluster." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../../../reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-proxy/index" target="_blank" aria-label="kube-proxy">kube-proxy</a>.</p>  <h2 id="management">Management</h2> <p>There are two main ways to have Nodes added to the <a class="glossary-tooltip" title="Control plane component that serves the Kubernetes API." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../../overview/components/index#kube-apiserver" target="_blank" aria-label="API server">API server</a>:</p> <ol> <li>The kubelet on a node self-registers to the control plane</li> <li>You (or another human user) manually add a Node object</li> </ol> <p>After you create a Node <a class="glossary-tooltip" title="A entity in the Kubernetes system, representing part of the state of your cluster." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../../overview/working-with-objects/kubernetes-objects/index#kubernetes-objects" target="_blank" aria-label="object">object</a>, or the kubelet on a node self-registers, the control plane checks whether the new Node object is valid. For example, if you try to create a Node from the following JSON manifest:</p> <div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4" data-language="json">{
  "kind": "Node",

    "labels": {
      "name": "my-first-k8s-node"
    }
  }
}
</pre></div>
<p>Kubernetes creates a Node object internally (the representation). Kubernetes checks that a kubelet has registered to the API server that matches the <code>metadata.name</code> field of the Node. If the node is healthy (i.e. all necessary services are running), then it is eligible to run a Pod. Otherwise, that node is ignored for any cluster activity until it becomes healthy.</p> <div class="alert alert-info note callout" role="alert"> <strong>Note:</strong> <p>Kubernetes keeps the object for the invalid Node and continues checking to see whether it becomes healthy.</p> <p>You, or a <a class="glossary-tooltip" title="A control loop that watches the shared state of the cluster through the apiserver and makes changes attempting to move the current state towards the desired state." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../../architecture/controller/index" target="_blank" aria-label="controller">controller</a>, must explicitly delete the Node object to stop that health checking.</p> </div> <p>The name of a Node object must be a valid <a href="../../overview/working-with-objects/names/index#dns-subdomain-names">DNS subdomain name</a>.</p> <h3 id="node-name-uniqueness">Node name uniqueness</h3> <p>The <a href="../../overview/working-with-objects/names/index#names">name</a> identifies a Node. Two Nodes cannot have the same name at the same time. Kubernetes also assumes that a resource with the same name is the same object. In case of a Node, it is implicitly assumed that an instance using the same name will have the same state (e.g. network settings, root disk contents) and attributes like node labels. This may lead to inconsistencies if an instance was modified without changing its name. If the Node needs to be replaced or updated significantly, the existing Node object needs to be removed from API server first and re-added after the update.</p> <h3 id="self-registration-of-nodes">Self-registration of Nodes</h3> <p>When the kubelet flag <code>--register-node</code> is true (the default), the kubelet will attempt to register itself with the API server. This is the preferred pattern, used by most distros.</p> <p>For self-registration, the kubelet is started with the following options:</p> <ul> <li> <p><code>--kubeconfig</code> - Path to credentials to authenticate itself to the API server.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>--cloud-provider</code> - How to talk to a <a class="glossary-tooltip" title="An organization that offers a cloud computing platform." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/glossary/?all=true#term-cloud-provider" target="_blank" aria-label="cloud provider">cloud provider</a> to read metadata about itself.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>--register-node</code> - Automatically register with the API server.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>--register-with-taints</code> - Register the node with the given list of <a class="glossary-tooltip" title="A core object consisting of three required properties: key, value, and effect.

For example, if the kubelet being restarted with the new set of <code>--node-labels</code>, but the same Node name is used, the change will not take an effect, as labels are being set on the Node registration.</p> <p>Pods already scheduled on the Node may misbehave or cause issues if the Node configuration will be changed on kubelet restart. For example, already running Pod may be tainted against the new labels assigned to the Node, while other Pods, that are incompatible with that Pod will be scheduled based on this new label. Node re-registration ensures all Pods will be drained and properly re-scheduled.</p> </div> <h3 id="manual-node-administration">Manual Node administration</h3> <p>You can create and modify Node objects using <a class="glossary-tooltip" title="A command line tool for communicating with a Kubernetes API server." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/kubectl-overview/" target="_blank" aria-label="kubectl">kubectl</a>.</p> <p>When you want to create Node objects manually, set the kubelet flag <code>--register-node=false</code>.</p> <p>You can modify Node objects regardless of the setting of <code>--register-node</code>. For example, you can set labels on an existing Node or mark it unschedulable.</p> <p>You can use labels on Nodes in conjunction with node selectors on Pods to control scheduling. For example, you can constrain a Pod to only be eligible to run on a subset of the available nodes.</p> <p>Marking a node as unschedulable prevents the scheduler from placing new pods onto that Node but does not affect existing Pods on the Node. This is useful as a preparatory step before a node reboot or other maintenance.</p> <p>To mark a Node unschedulable, run:</p> <div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4" data-language="shell">kubectl cordon $NODENAME

For example, the following JSON structure describes a healthy node:</p> <div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4" data-language="json">"conditions": [

    "lastTransitionTime": "2019-06-05T11:41:27Z"
  }
]
</pre></div>
<p>If the <code>status</code> of the Ready condition remains <code>Unknown</code> or <code>False</code> for longer than the <code>pod-eviction-timeout</code> (an argument passed to the <a class="glossary-tooltip" title="Control Plane component that runs controller processes." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../../../reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-controller-manager/index" target="_blank" aria-label="kube-controller-manager">kube-controller-manager</a>), then the <a href="#node-controller">node controller</a> triggers <a class="glossary-tooltip" title="API-initiated eviction is the process by which you use the Eviction API to create an Eviction object that triggers graceful pod termination." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../../scheduling-eviction/api-eviction/index" target="_blank" aria-label="API-initiated eviction">API-initiated eviction</a> for all Pods assigned to that node. The default eviction timeout duration is <strong>five minutes</strong>. In some cases when the node is unreachable, the API server is unable to communicate with the kubelet on the node. The decision to delete the pods cannot be communicated to the kubelet until communication with the API server is re-established. In the meantime, the pods that are scheduled for deletion may continue to run on the partitioned node.</p> <p>The node controller does not force delete pods until it is confirmed that they have stopped running in the cluster. You can see the pods that might be running on an unreachable node as being in the <code>Terminating</code> or <code>Unknown</code> state. In cases where Kubernetes cannot deduce from the underlying infrastructure if a node has permanently left a cluster, the cluster administrator may need to delete the node object by hand. Deleting the node object from Kubernetes causes all the Pod objects running on the node to be deleted from the API server and frees up their names.</p> <p>When problems occur on nodes, the Kubernetes control plane automatically creates <a href="../../scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/index">taints</a> that match the conditions affecting the node. The scheduler takes the Node's taints into consideration when assigning a Pod to a Node. Pods can also have <a class="glossary-tooltip" title="A core object consisting of three required properties: key, value, and effect. Tolerations enable the scheduling of pods on nodes or node groups that have a matching taint." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../../scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/index" target="_blank" aria-label="tolerations">tolerations</a> that let them run on a Node even though it has a specific taint.</p> <p>See <a href="../../scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/index#taint-nodes-by-condition">Taint Nodes by Condition</a> for more details.</p> <h3 id="capacity">Capacity and Allocatable</h3> <p>Describes the resources available on the node: CPU, memory, and the maximum number of pods that can be scheduled onto the node.</p> <p>The fields in the capacity block indicate the total amount of resources that a Node has. The allocatable block indicates the amount of resources on a Node that is available to be consumed by normal Pods.</p> <p>You may read more about capacity and allocatable resources while learning how to <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/reserve-compute-resources/#node-allocatable">reserve compute resources</a> on a Node.</p> <h3 id="info">Info</h3> <p>Describes general information about the node, such as kernel version, Kubernetes version (kubelet and kube-proxy version), container runtime details, and which operating system the node uses. The kubelet gathers this information from the node and publishes it into the Kubernetes API.</p> <h2 id="heartbeats">Heartbeats</h2> <p>Heartbeats, sent by Kubernetes nodes, help your cluster determine the availability of each node, and to take action when failures are detected.</p> <p>For nodes there are two forms of heartbeats:</p> <ul> <li>updates to the <code>.status</code> of a Node</li> <li>
<a href="../../../reference/kubernetes-api/cluster-resources/lease-v1/index">Lease</a> objects within the <code>kube-node-lease</code> <a class="glossary-tooltip" title="An abstraction used by Kubernetes to support multiple virtual clusters on the same physical cluster." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../../overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/index" target="_blank" aria-label="namespace">namespace</a>. Each Node has an associated Lease object.</li> </ul> <p>Compared to updates to <code>.status</code> of a Node, a Lease is a lightweight resource. Using Leases for heartbeats reduces the performance impact of these updates for large clusters.</p> <p>The kubelet is responsible for creating and updating the <code>.status</code> of Nodes, and for updating their related Leases.</p> <ul> <li>The kubelet updates the node's <code>.status</code> either when there is change in status or if there has been no update for a configured interval. The default interval for <code>.status</code> updates to Nodes is 5 minutes, which is much longer than the 40 second default timeout for unreachable nodes.</li> <li>The kubelet creates and then updates its Lease object every 10 seconds (the default update interval). Lease updates occur independently from updates to the Node's <code>.status</code>. If the Lease update fails, the kubelet retries, using exponential backoff that starts at 200 milliseconds and capped at 7 seconds.</li> </ul> <h2 id="node-controller">Node controller</h2> <p>The node <a class="glossary-tooltip" title="A control loop that watches the shared state of the cluster through the apiserver and makes changes attempting to move the current state towards the desired state." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../../architecture/controller/index" target="_blank" aria-label="controller">controller</a> is a Kubernetes control plane component that manages various aspects of nodes.</p> <p>The node controller has multiple roles in a node's life. The first is assigning a CIDR block to the node when it is registered (if CIDR assignment is turned on).</p> <p>The second is keeping the node controller's internal list of nodes up to date with the cloud provider's list of available machines. When running in a cloud environment and whenever a node is unhealthy, the node controller asks the cloud provider if the VM for that node is still available. If not, the node controller deletes the node from its list of nodes.</p> <p>The third is monitoring the nodes' health. The node controller is responsible for:</p> <ul> <li>In the case that a node becomes unreachable, updating the NodeReady condition of within the Node's <code>.status</code>. In this case the node controller sets the NodeReady condition to <code>ConditionUnknown</code>.</li> <li>If a node remains unreachable: triggering <a href="../../scheduling-eviction/api-eviction/index">API-initiated eviction</a> for all of the Pods on the unreachable node. By default, the node controller waits 5 minutes between marking the node as <code>ConditionUnknown</code> and submitting the first eviction request.</li> </ul> <p>The node controller checks the state of each node every <code>--node-monitor-period</code> seconds.</p> <h3 id="rate-limits-on-eviction">Rate limits on eviction</h3> <p>In most cases, the node controller limits the eviction rate to <code>--node-eviction-rate</code> (default 0.1) per second, meaning it won't evict pods from more than 1 node per 10 seconds.</p> <p>The node eviction behavior changes when a node in a given availability zone becomes unhealthy. The node controller checks what percentage of nodes in the zone are unhealthy (NodeReady condition is <code>ConditionUnknown</code> or <code>ConditionFalse</code>) at the same time:</p> <ul> <li>If the fraction of unhealthy nodes is at least <code>--unhealthy-zone-threshold</code> (default 0.55), then the eviction rate is reduced.</li> <li>If the cluster is small (i.e. has less than or equal to <code>--large-cluster-size-threshold</code> nodes - default 50), then evictions are stopped.</li> <li>Otherwise, the eviction rate is reduced to <code>--secondary-node-eviction-rate</code> (default 0.01) per second.</li> </ul> <p>The reason these policies are implemented per availability zone is because one availability zone might become partitioned from the master while the others remain connected. If your cluster does not span multiple cloud provider availability zones, then the eviction mechanism does not take per-zone unavailability into account.</p> <p>A key reason for spreading your nodes across availability zones is so that the workload can be shifted to healthy zones when one entire zone goes down. Therefore, if all nodes in a zone are unhealthy, then the node controller evicts at the normal rate of <code>--node-eviction-rate</code>. The corner case is when all zones are completely unhealthy (none of the nodes in the cluster are healthy). In such a case, the node controller assumes that there is some problem with connectivity between the control plane and the nodes, and doesn't perform any evictions. (If there has been an outage and some nodes reappear, the node controller does evict pods from the remaining nodes that are unhealthy or unreachable).</p> <p>The node controller is also responsible for evicting pods running on nodes with <code>NoExecute</code> taints, unless those pods tolerate that taint. The node controller also adds <a class="glossary-tooltip" title="A core object consisting of three required properties: key, value, and effect. Taints prevent the scheduling of pods on nodes or node groups." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../../scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/index" target="_blank" aria-label="taints">taints</a> corresponding to node problems like node unreachable or not ready. This means that the scheduler won't place Pods onto unhealthy nodes.</p> <h2 id="node-capacity">Resource capacity tracking</h2> <p>Node objects track information about the Node's resource capacity: for example, the amount of memory available and the number of CPUs. Nodes that <a href="#self-registration-of-nodes">self register</a> report their capacity during registration. If you <a href="#manual-node-administration">manually</a> add a Node, then you need to set the node's capacity information when you add it.</p> <p>The Kubernetes <a class="glossary-tooltip" title="Control plane component that watches for newly created pods with no assigned node, and selects a node for them to run on." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../../../reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-scheduler/index" target="_blank" aria-label="scheduler">scheduler</a> ensures that there are enough resources for all the Pods on a Node. The scheduler checks that the sum of the requests of containers on the node is no greater than the node's capacity. That sum of requests includes all containers managed by the kubelet, but excludes any containers started directly by the container runtime, and also excludes any processes running outside of the kubelet's control.</p> <div class="alert alert-info note callout" role="alert"> <strong>Note:</strong> If you want to explicitly reserve resources for non-Pod processes, see <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/reserve-compute-resources/#system-reserved">reserve resources for system daemons</a>. </div> <h2 id="node-topology">Node topology</h2> <div style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"> <b>FEATURE STATE:</b> <code>Kubernetes v1.16 [alpha]</code> </div> <p>If you have enabled the <code>TopologyManager</code> <a href="../../../reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/index">feature gate</a>, then the kubelet can use topology hints when making resource assignment decisions.

To activate the feature, the two kubelet config settings should be configured appropriately and set to non-zero values.</p> <p>During a graceful shutdown, kubelet terminates pods in two phases:</p> <ol> <li>Terminate regular pods running on the node.</li> <li>Terminate <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/guaranteed-scheduling-critical-addon-pods/#marking-pod-as-critical">critical pods</a> running on the node.</li> </ol> <p>Graceful node shutdown feature is configured with two <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kubelet-config-file/"><code>KubeletConfiguration</code></a> options:</p> <ul> <li>
<code>shutdownGracePeriod</code>: <ul> <li>Specifies the total duration that the node should delay the shutdown by. This is the total grace period for pod termination for both regular and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/guaranteed-scheduling-critical-addon-pods/#marking-pod-as-critical">critical pods</a>.</li> </ul> </li> <li>
<code>shutdownGracePeriodCriticalPods</code>: <ul> <li>Specifies the duration used to terminate <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/guaranteed-scheduling-critical-addon-pods/#marking-pod-as-critical">critical pods</a> during a node shutdown. This value should be less than <code>shutdownGracePeriod</code>.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>For example, if <code>shutdownGracePeriod=30s</code>, and <code>shutdownGracePeriodCriticalPods=10s</code>, kubelet will delay the node shutdown by 30 seconds. During the shutdown, the first 20 (30-10) seconds would be reserved for gracefully terminating normal pods, and the last 10 seconds would be reserved for terminating <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/guaranteed-scheduling-critical-addon-pods/#marking-pod-as-critical">critical pods</a>.</p> <div class="alert alert-info note callout" role="alert"> <strong>Note:</strong> <p>When pods were evicted during the graceful node shutdown, they are marked as shutdown.

The feature allows cluster administers to explicitly define the ordering of pods during graceful node shutdown based on <a href="docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/pod-priority-preemption/index#priorityclass">priority classes</a>.</p> <p>The <a href="#graceful-node-shutdown">Graceful Node Shutdown</a> feature, as described above, shuts down pods in two phases, non-critical pods, followed by critical pods. If additional flexibility is needed to explicitly define the ordering of pods during shutdown in a more granular way, pod priority based graceful shutdown can be used.</p> <p>When graceful node shutdown honors pod priorities, this makes it possible to do graceful node shutdown in multiple phases, each phase shutting down a particular priority class of pods. The kubelet can be configured with the exact phases and shutdown time per phase.</p> <p>Assuming the following custom pod <a href="docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/pod-priority-preemption/index#priorityclass">priority classes</a> in a cluster,</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Pod priority class name</th> <th>Pod priority class value</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><code>custom-class-a</code></td> <td>100000</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>custom-class-b</code></td> <td>10000</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>custom-class-c</code></td> <td>1000</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>regular/unset</code></td> <td>0</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>Within the <a href="../../../reference/config-api/kubelet-config.v1beta1/index#kubelet-config-k8s-io-v1beta1-KubeletConfiguration">kubelet configuration</a> the settings for <code>shutdownGracePeriodByPodPriority</code> could look like:</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Pod priority class value</th> <th>Shutdown period</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>100000</td> <td>10 seconds</td> </tr> <tr> <td>10000</td> <td>180 seconds</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1000</td> <td>120 seconds</td> </tr> <tr> <td>0</td> <td>60 seconds</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>The corresponding kubelet config YAML configuration would be:</p> <div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4" data-language="yaml">shutdownGracePeriodByPodPriority:

    shutdownGracePeriodSeconds: 10
  - priority: 10000

  - priority: 1000
    shutdownGracePeriodSeconds: 120
  - priority: 0
    shutdownGracePeriodSeconds: 60
</pre></div>
<p>The above table implies that any pod with priority value &gt;= 100000 will get just 10 seconds to stop, any pod with value &gt;= 10000 and &lt; 100000 will get 180 seconds to stop, any pod with value &gt;= 1000 and &lt; 10000 will get 120 seconds to stop. Finally, all other pods will get 60 seconds to stop.</p> <p>One doesn't have to specify values corresponding to all of the classes. For example, you could instead use these settings:</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Pod priority class value</th> <th>Shutdown period</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>100000</td> <td>300 seconds</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1000</td> <td>120 seconds</td> </tr> <tr> <td>0</td> <td>60 seconds</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>In the above case, the pods with custom-class-b will go into the same bucket as custom-class-c for shutdown.</p> <p>If there are no pods in a particular range, then the kubelet does not wait for pods in that priority range. Instead, the kubelet immediately skips to the next priority class value range.</p> <p>If this feature is enabled and no configuration is provided, then no ordering action will be taken.</p> <p>Using this feature, requires enabling the <code>GracefulNodeShutdownBasedOnPodPriority</code> feature gate, and setting the kubelet config's <code>ShutdownGracePeriodByPodPriority</code> to the desired configuration containing the pod priority class values and their respective shutdown periods.</p> <h2 id="swap-memory">Swap memory management</h2> <div style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"> <b>FEATURE STATE:</b> <code>Kubernetes v1.22 [alpha]</code> </div> <p>Prior to Kubernetes 1.22, nodes did not support the use of swap memory, and a kubelet would by default fail to start if swap was detected on a node.

<p>The available configuration options for <code>swapBehavior</code> are:</p> <ul> <li>
<code>LimitedSwap</code>: Kubernetes workloads are limited in how much swap they can use. Workloads on the node not managed by Kubernetes can still swap.</li> <li>
<code>UnlimitedSwap</code>: Kubernetes workloads can use as much swap memory as they request, up to the system limit.</li> </ul> <p>If configuration for <code>memorySwap</code> is not specified and the feature gate is enabled, by default the kubelet will apply the same behaviour as the <code>LimitedSwap</code> setting.</p> <p>The behaviour of the <code>LimitedSwap</code> setting depends if the node is running with v1 or v2 of control groups (also known as "cgroups"):</p> <ul> <li>
<strong>cgroupsv1:</strong> Kubernetes workloads can use any combination of memory and swap, up to the pod's memory limit, if set.</li> <li>
