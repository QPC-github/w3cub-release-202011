<h1>Topology Aware Hints</h1>  <div style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"> <b>FEATURE STATE:</b> <code>Kubernetes v1.23 [beta]</code> </div> <p><em>Topology Aware Hints</em> enable topology aware routing by including suggestions for how clients should consume endpoints. This approach adds metadata to enable consumers of EndpointSlice and / or Endpoints objects, so that traffic to those network endpoints can be routed closer to where it originated.</p> <p>For example, you can route traffic within a locality to reduce costs, or to improve network performance.</p>  <h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2> <p>Kubernetes clusters are increasingly deployed in multi-zone environments. <em>Topology Aware Hints</em> provides a mechanism to help keep traffic within the zone it originated from. This concept is commonly referred to as "Topology Aware Routing". When calculating the endpoints for a <a class="glossary-tooltip" title="A way to expose an application running on a set of Pods as a network service." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../service/index" target="_blank" aria-label="Service">Service</a>, the EndpointSlice controller considers the topology (region and zone) of each endpoint and populates the hints field to allocate it to a zone. Cluster components such as the <a class="glossary-tooltip" title="kube-proxy is a network proxy that runs on each node in the cluster." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../../../reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-proxy/index" target="_blank" aria-label="kube-proxy">kube-proxy</a> can then consume those hints, and use them to influence how traffic to is routed (favoring topologically closer endpoints).</p> <h2 id="using-topology-aware-hints">Using Topology Aware Hints</h2> <p>You can activate Topology Aware Hints for a Service by setting the <code>service.kubernetes.io/topology-aware-hints</code> annotation to <code>auto</code>. This tells the EndpointSlice controller to set topology hints if it is deemed safe. Importantly, this does not guarantee that hints will always be set.</p> <h2 id="implementation">How it works</h2> <p>The functionality enabling this feature is split into two components: The EndpointSlice controller and the kube-proxy. This section provides a high level overview of how each component implements this feature.</p> <h3 id="implementation-control-plane">EndpointSlice controller</h3> <p>The EndpointSlice controller is responsible for setting hints on EndpointSlices when this feature is enabled. The controller allocates a proportional amount of endpoints to each zone. This proportion is based on the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/reserve-compute-resources/#node-allocatable">allocatable</a> CPU cores for nodes running in that zone. For example, if one zone had 2 CPU cores and another zone only had 1 CPU core, the controller would allocated twice as many endpoints to the zone with 2 CPU cores.</p> <p>The following example shows what an EndpointSlice looks like when hints have been populated:</p> <div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4" data-language="yaml">apiVersion: discovery.k8s.io/v1
kind: EndpointSlice
metadata:
  name: example-hints
  labels:
    kubernetes.io/service-name: example-svc
addressType: IPv4
ports:
  - name: http
    protocol: TCP
    port: 80
endpoints:
  - addresses:
      - "10.1.2.3"
    conditions:
      ready: true
    hostname: pod-1
    zone: zone-a
    hints:
      forZones:
        - name: "zone-a"
</pre></div>
<h3 id="implementation-kube-proxy">kube-proxy</h3> <p>The kube-proxy component filters the endpoints it routes to based on the hints set by the EndpointSlice controller. In most cases, this means that the kube-proxy is able to route traffic to endpoints in the same zone. Sometimes the controller allocates endpoints from a different zone to ensure more even distribution of endpoints between zones. This would result in some traffic being routed to other zones.</p> <h2 id="safeguards">Safeguards</h2> <p>The Kubernetes control plane and the kube-proxy on each node apply some safeguard rules before using Topology Aware Hints. If these don't check out, the kube-proxy selects endpoints from anywhere in your cluster, regardless of the zone.</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Insufficient number of endpoints:</strong> If there are less endpoints than zones in a cluster, the controller will not assign any hints.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Impossible to achieve balanced allocation:</strong> In some cases, it will be impossible to achieve a balanced allocation of endpoints among zones. For example, if zone-a is twice as large as zone-b, but there are only 2 endpoints, an endpoint allocated to zone-a may receive twice as much traffic as zone-b. The controller does not assign hints if it can't get this "expected overload" value below an acceptable threshold for each zone. Importantly this is not based on real-time feedback. It is still possible for individual endpoints to become overloaded.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>One or more Nodes has insufficient information:</strong> If any node does not have a <code>topology.kubernetes.io/zone</code> label or is not reporting a value for allocatable CPU, the control plane does not set any topology-aware endpoint hints and so kube-proxy does not filter endpoints by zone.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>One or more endpoints does not have a zone hint:</strong> When this happens, the kube-proxy assumes that a transition from or to Topology Aware Hints is underway. Filtering endpoints for a Service in this state would be dangerous so the kube-proxy falls back to using all endpoints.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>A zone is not represented in hints:</strong> If the kube-proxy is unable to find at least one endpoint with a hint targeting the zone it is running in, it falls to using endpoints from all zones. This is most likely to happen as you add a new zone into your existing cluster.</p> </li> </ol> <h2 id="constraints">Constraints</h2> <ul> <li> <p>Topology Aware Hints are not used when either <code>externalTrafficPolicy</code> or <code>internalTrafficPolicy</code> is set to <code>Local</code> on a Service. It is possible to use both features in the same cluster on different Services, just not on the same Service.</p> </li> <li> <p>This approach will not work well for Services that have a large proportion of traffic originating from a subset of zones. Instead this assumes that incoming traffic will be roughly proportional to the capacity of the Nodes in each zone.</p> </li> <li> <p>The EndpointSlice controller ignores unready nodes as it calculates the proportions of each zone. This could have unintended consequences if a large portion of nodes are unready.</p> </li> <li> <p>The EndpointSlice controller does not take into account <a class="glossary-tooltip" title="A core object consisting of three required properties: key, value, and effect. Tolerations enable the scheduling of pods on nodes or node groups that have a matching taint." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../../scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/index" target="_blank" aria-label="tolerations">tolerations</a> when deploying calculating the proportions of each zone. If the Pods backing a Service are limited to a subset of Nodes in the cluster, this will not be taken into account.</p> </li> <li> <p>This may not work well with autoscaling. For example, if a lot of traffic is originating from a single zone, only the endpoints allocated to that zone will be handling that traffic. That could result in <a class="glossary-tooltip" title="An API resource that automatically scales the number of pod replicas based on targeted CPU utilization or custom metric targets." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../../../tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/index" target="_blank" aria-label="Horizontal Pod Autoscaler">Horizontal Pod Autoscaler</a> either not picking up on this event, or newly added pods starting in a different zone.</p> </li> </ul> <h2 id="what-s-next">What's next</h2> <ul> <li>Read <a href="../connect-applications-service/index">Connecting Applications with Services</a>
