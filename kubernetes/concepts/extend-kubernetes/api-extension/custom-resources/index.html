<h1>Custom Resources</h1>  <p><em>Custom resources</em> are extensions of the Kubernetes API. This page discusses when to add a custom resource to your Kubernetes cluster and when to use a standalone service. It describes the two methods for adding custom resources and how to choose between them.</p>  <h2 id="custom-resources">Custom resources</h2> <p>A <em>resource</em> is an endpoint in the <a href="../../../overview/kubernetes-api/index">Kubernetes API</a> that stores a collection of <a href="../../../overview/working-with-objects/kubernetes-objects/index">API objects</a> of a certain kind; for example, the built-in <em>pods</em> resource contains a collection of Pod objects.</p> <p>A <em>custom resource</em> is an extension of the Kubernetes API that is not necessarily available in a default Kubernetes installation. It represents a customization of a particular Kubernetes installation. However, many core Kubernetes functions are now built using custom resources, making Kubernetes more modular.</p> <p>Custom resources can appear and disappear in a running cluster through dynamic registration, and cluster admins can update custom resources independently of the cluster itself. Once a custom resource is installed, users can create and access its objects using <a href="../../../../reference/kubectl/overview/index">kubectl</a>, just as they do for built-in resources like <em>Pods</em>.</p> <h2 id="custom-controllers">Custom controllers</h2> <p>On their own, custom resources let you store and retrieve structured data. When you combine a custom resource with a <em>custom controller</em>, custom resources provide a true <em>declarative API</em>.</p> <p>The Kubernetes <a href="../../../overview/kubernetes-api/index">declarative API</a> enforces a separation of responsibilities. You declare the desired state of your resource. The Kubernetes controller keeps the current state of Kubernetes objects in sync with your declared desired state. This is in contrast to an imperative API, where you <em>instruct</em> a server what to do.</p> <p>You can deploy and update a custom controller on a running cluster, independently of the cluster's lifecycle. Custom controllers can work with any kind of resource, but they are especially effective when combined with custom resources. The <a href="../../operator/index">Operator pattern</a> combines custom resources and custom controllers. You can use custom controllers to encode domain knowledge for specific applications into an extension of the Kubernetes API.</p> <h2 id="should-i-add-a-custom-resource-to-my-kubernetes-cluster">Should I add a custom resource to my Kubernetes Cluster?</h2> <p>When creating a new API, consider whether to <a href="../apiserver-aggregation/index">aggregate your API with the Kubernetes cluster APIs</a> or let your API stand alone.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Consider API aggregation if:</th> <th>Prefer a stand-alone API if:</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Your API is <a href="#declarative-apis">Declarative</a>.</td> <td>Your API does not fit the <a href="#declarative-apis">Declarative</a> model.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>You want your new types to be readable and writable using <code>kubectl</code>.</td> <td>
<code>kubectl</code> support is not required</td> </tr> <tr> <td>You want to view your new types in a Kubernetes UI, such as dashboard, alongside built-in types.</td> <td>Kubernetes UI support is not required.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>You are developing a new API.</td> <td>You already have a program that serves your API and works well.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>You are willing to accept the format restriction that Kubernetes puts on REST resource paths, such as API Groups and Namespaces. (See the <a href="../../../overview/kubernetes-api/index">API Overview</a>.)</td> <td>You need to have specific REST paths to be compatible with an already defined REST API.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Your resources are naturally scoped to a cluster or namespaces of a cluster.</td> <td>Cluster or namespace scoped resources are a poor fit; you need control over the specifics of resource paths.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>You want to reuse <a href="#common-features">Kubernetes API support features</a>.</td> <td>You don't need those features.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h3 id="declarative-apis">Declarative APIs</h3> <p>In a Declarative API, typically:</p> <ul> <li>Your API consists of a relatively small number of relatively small objects (resources).</li> <li>The objects define configuration of applications or infrastructure.</li> <li>The objects are updated relatively infrequently.</li> <li>Humans often need to read and write the objects.</li> <li>The main operations on the objects are CRUD-y (creating, reading, updating and deleting).</li> <li>Transactions across objects are not required: the API represents a desired state, not an exact state.</li> </ul> <p>Imperative APIs are not declarative. Signs that your API might not be declarative include:</p> <ul> <li>The client says "do this", and then gets a synchronous response back when it is done.</li> <li>The client says "do this", and then gets an operation ID back, and has to check a separate Operation object to determine completion of the request.</li> <li>You talk about Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs).</li> <li>Directly storing large amounts of data; for example, &gt; a few kB per object, or &gt; 1000s of objects.</li> <li>High bandwidth access (10s of requests per second sustained) needed.</li> <li>Store end-user data (such as images, PII, etc.) or other large-scale data processed by applications.</li> <li>The natural operations on the objects are not CRUD-y.</li> <li>The API is not easily modeled as objects.</li> <li>You chose to represent pending operations with an operation ID or an operation object.</li> </ul> <h2 id="should-i-use-a-configmap-or-a-custom-resource">Should I use a configMap or a custom resource?</h2> <p>Use a ConfigMap if any of the following apply:</p> <ul> <li>There is an existing, well-documented config file format, such as a <code>mysql.cnf</code> or <code>pom.xml</code>.</li> <li>You want to put the entire config file into one key of a configMap.</li> <li>The main use of the config file is for a program running in a Pod on your cluster to consume the file to configure itself.</li> <li>Consumers of the file prefer to consume via file in a Pod or environment variable in a pod, rather than the Kubernetes API.</li> <li>You want to perform rolling updates via Deployment, etc., when the file is updated.</li> </ul> <div class="alert alert-info note callout" role="alert"> <strong>Note:</strong> Use a <a href="../../../configuration/secret/index">secret</a> for sensitive data, which is similar to a configMap but more secure. </div> <p>Use a custom resource (CRD or Aggregated API) if most of the following apply:</p> <ul> <li>You want to use Kubernetes client libraries and CLIs to create and update the new resource.</li> <li>You want top-level support from <code>kubectl</code>; for example, <code>kubectl get my-object object-name</code>.</li> <li>You want to build new automation that watches for updates on the new object, and then CRUD other objects, or vice versa.</li> <li>You want to write automation that handles updates to the object.</li> <li>You want to use Kubernetes API conventions like <code>.spec</code>, <code>.status</code>, and <code>.metadata</code>.</li> <li>You want the object to be an abstraction over a collection of controlled resources, or a summarization of other resources.</li> </ul> <h2 id="adding-custom-resources">Adding custom resources</h2> <p>Kubernetes provides two ways to add custom resources to your cluster:</p> <ul> <li>CRDs are simple and can be created without any programming.</li> <li>
<a href="../apiserver-aggregation/index">API Aggregation</a> requires programming, but allows more control over API behaviors like how data is stored and conversion between API versions.</li> </ul> <p>Kubernetes provides these two options to meet the needs of different users, so that neither ease of use nor flexibility is compromised.</p> <p>Aggregated APIs are subordinate API servers that sit behind the primary API server, which acts as a proxy. This arrangement is called <a href="../apiserver-aggregation/index">API Aggregation</a> (AA). To users, the Kubernetes API appears extended.</p> <p>CRDs allow users to create new types of resources without adding another API server. You do not need to understand API Aggregation to use CRDs.</p> <p>Regardless of how they are installed, the new resources are referred to as Custom Resources to distinguish them from built-in Kubernetes resources (like pods).</p> <h2 id="customresourcedefinitions">CustomResourceDefinitions</h2> <p>The <a href="../../../../tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/index">CustomResourceDefinition</a> API resource allows you to define custom resources. Defining a CRD object creates a new custom resource with a name and schema that you specify. The Kubernetes API serves and handles the storage of your custom resource. The name of a CRD object must be a valid <a href="../../../overview/working-with-objects/names/index#dns-subdomain-names">DNS subdomain name</a>.</p> <p>This frees you from writing your own API server to handle the custom resource, but the generic nature of the implementation means you have less flexibility than with <a href="#api-server-aggregation">API server aggregation</a>.</p> <p>Refer to the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/sample-controller">custom controller example</a> for an example of how to register a new custom resource, work with instances of your new resource type, and use a controller to handle events.</p> <h2 id="api-server-aggregation">API server aggregation</h2> <p>Usually, each resource in the Kubernetes API requires code that handles REST requests and manages persistent storage of objects. The main Kubernetes API server handles built-in resources like <em>pods</em> and <em>services</em>, and can also generically handle custom resources through <a href="#customresourcedefinitions">CRDs</a>.</p> <p>The <a href="../apiserver-aggregation/index">aggregation layer</a> allows you to provide specialized implementations for your custom resources by writing and deploying your own API server. The main API server delegates requests to your API server for the custom resources that you handle, making them available to all of its clients.</p> <h2 id="choosing-a-method-for-adding-custom-resources">Choosing a method for adding custom resources</h2> <p>CRDs are easier to use. Aggregated APIs are more flexible. Choose the method that best meets your needs.</p> <p>Typically, CRDs are a good fit if:</p> <ul> <li>You have a handful of fields</li> <li>You are using the resource within your company, or as part of a small open-source project (as opposed to a commercial product)</li> </ul> <h3 id="comparing-ease-of-use">Comparing ease of use</h3> <p>CRDs are easier to create than Aggregated APIs.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>CRDs</th> <th>Aggregated API</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Do not require programming. Users can choose any language for a CRD controller.</td> <td>Requires programming and building binary and image.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>No additional service to run; CRDs are handled by API server.</td> <td>An additional service to create and that could fail.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>No ongoing support once the CRD is created. Any bug fixes are picked up as part of normal Kubernetes Master upgrades.</td> <td>May need to periodically pickup bug fixes from upstream and rebuild and update the Aggregated API server.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>No need to handle multiple versions of your API; for example, when you control the client for this resource, you can upgrade it in sync with the API.</td> <td>You need to handle multiple versions of your API; for example, when developing an extension to share with the world.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h3 id="advanced-features-and-flexibility">Advanced features and flexibility</h3> <p>Aggregated APIs offer more advanced API features and customization of other features; for example, the storage layer.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Feature</th> <th>Description</th> <th>CRDs</th> <th>Aggregated API</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Validation</td> <td>Help users prevent errors and allow you to evolve your API independently of your clients.

You'll need to explicitly grant access to the new resources.
