<h1>Deployments</h1>  <p>A <em>Deployment</em> provides declarative updates for <a class="glossary-tooltip" title="A Pod represents a set of running containers in your cluster." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../pods/index" target="_blank" aria-label="Pods">Pods</a> and <a class="glossary-tooltip" title="ReplicaSet ensures that a specified number of Pod replicas are running at one time" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="replicaset/index" target="_blank" aria-label="ReplicaSets">ReplicaSets</a>.</p> <p>You describe a <em>desired state</em> in a Deployment, and the Deployment <a class="glossary-tooltip" title="A control loop that watches the shared state of the cluster through the apiserver and makes changes attempting to move the current state towards the desired state." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../../architecture/controller/index" target="_blank" aria-label="Controller">Controller</a> changes the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate. You can define Deployments to create new ReplicaSets, or to remove existing Deployments and adopt all their resources with new Deployments.</p> <div class="alert alert-info note callout" role="alert"> <strong>Note:</strong> Do not manage ReplicaSets owned by a Deployment. Consider opening an issue in the main Kubernetes repository if your use case is not covered below. </div>  <h2 id="use-case">Use Case</h2> <p>The following are typical use cases for Deployments:</p> <ul> <li>
<a href="#creating-a-deployment">Create a Deployment to rollout a ReplicaSet</a>. The ReplicaSet creates Pods in the background. Check the status of the rollout to see if it succeeds or not.</li> <li>
<a href="#updating-a-deployment">Declare the new state of the Pods</a> by updating the PodTemplateSpec of the Deployment. A new ReplicaSet is created and the Deployment manages moving the Pods from the old ReplicaSet to the new one at a controlled rate. Each new ReplicaSet updates the revision of the Deployment.</li> <li>
<a href="#rolling-back-a-deployment">Rollback to an earlier Deployment revision</a> if the current state of the Deployment is not stable. Each rollback updates the revision of the Deployment.</li> <li>
<a href="#scaling-a-deployment">Scale up the Deployment to facilitate more load</a>.</li> <li>
<a href="#pausing-and-resuming-a-deployment">Pause the rollout of a Deployment</a> to apply multiple fixes to its PodTemplateSpec and then resume it to start a new rollout.</li> <li>
<a href="#deployment-status">Use the status of the Deployment</a> as an indicator that a rollout has stuck.</li> <li>
<a href="#clean-up-policy">Clean up older ReplicaSets</a> that you don't need anymore.</li> </ul> <h2 id="creating-a-deployment">Creating a Deployment</h2> <p>The following is an example of a Deployment. It creates a ReplicaSet to bring up three <code>nginx</code> Pods:</p> <pre class="highlight" data-language="">controllers/nginx-deployment.yaml</pre> <p>In this example:</p> <ul> <li> <p>A Deployment named <code>nginx-deployment</code> is created, indicated by the <code>.metadata.name</code> field.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Deployment creates three replicated Pods, indicated by the <code>.spec.replicas</code> field.</p> </li> <li> <p>The <code>.spec.selector</code> field defines how the Deployment finds which Pods to manage. In this case, you select a label that is defined in the Pod template (<code>app: nginx</code>). However, more sophisticated selection rules are possible, as long as the Pod template itself satisfies the rule.</p> <div class="alert alert-info note callout" role="alert"> <strong>Note:</strong> The <code>.spec.selector.matchLabels</code> field is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the <code>matchLabels</code> map is equivalent to an element of <code>matchExpressions</code>, whose <code>key</code> field is "key", the <code>operator</code> is "In", and the <code>values</code> array contains only "value". All of the requirements, from both <code>matchLabels</code> and <code>matchExpressions</code>, must be satisfied in order to match. </div> </li> <li> <p>The <code>template</code> field contains the following sub-fields:</p> <ul> <li>The Pods are labeled <code>app: nginx</code>using the <code>.metadata.labels</code> field.</li> <li>The Pod template's specification, or <code>.template.spec</code> field, indicates that the Pods run one container, <code>nginx</code>, which runs the <code>nginx</code> <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">Docker Hub</a> image at version 1.14.2.</li> <li>Create one container and name it <code>nginx</code> using the <code>.spec.template.spec.containers[0].name</code> field.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Before you begin, make sure your Kubernetes cluster is up and running. Follow the steps given below to create the above Deployment:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Create the Deployment by running the following command:</p> <pre class="highlight" data-language="shell">kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/controllers/nginx-deployment.yaml
</pre>
</li> <li> <p>Run <code>kubectl get deployments</code> to check if the Deployment was created.</p> <p>If the Deployment is still being created, the output is similar to the following:</p> <pre><code>NAME               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
nginx-deployment   0/3     0            0           1s
</code></pre>
<p>When you inspect the Deployments in your cluster, the following fields are displayed:</p> <ul> <li>
<code>NAME</code> lists the names of the Deployments in the namespace.</li> <li>
<code>READY</code> displays how many replicas of the application are available to your users. It follows the pattern ready/desired.</li> <li>
<code>UP-TO-DATE</code> displays the number of replicas that have been updated to achieve the desired state.</li> <li>
<code>AVAILABLE</code> displays how many replicas of the application are available to your users.</li> <li>
<code>AGE</code> displays the amount of time that the application has been running.</li> </ul> <p>Notice how the number of desired replicas is 3 according to <code>.spec.replicas</code> field.</p> </li> <li> <p>To see the Deployment rollout status, run <code>kubectl rollout status deployment/nginx-deployment</code>.</p> <p>The output is similar to:</p> <pre><code>Waiting for rollout to finish: 2 out of 3 new replicas have been updated...
deployment "nginx-deployment" successfully rolled out
</code></pre>
</li> <li> <p>Run the <code>kubectl get deployments</code> again a few seconds later. The output is similar to this:</p> <pre><code>NAME               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
nginx-deployment   3/3     3            3           18s
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that the Deployment has created all three replicas, and all replicas are up-to-date (they contain the latest Pod template) and available.</p> </li> <li> <p>To see the ReplicaSet (<code>rs</code>) created by the Deployment, run <code>kubectl get rs</code>. The output is similar to this:</p> <pre><code>NAME                          DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
nginx-deployment-75675f5897   3         3         3       18s
</code></pre>
<p>ReplicaSet output shows the following fields:</p> <ul> <li>
<code>NAME</code> lists the names of the ReplicaSets in the namespace.</li> <li>
<code>DESIRED</code> displays the desired number of <em>replicas</em> of the application, which you define when you create the Deployment. This is the <em>desired state</em>.</li> <li>
<code>CURRENT</code> displays how many replicas are currently running.</li> <li>
<code>READY</code> displays how many replicas of the application are available to your users.</li> <li>
<code>AGE</code> displays the amount of time that the application has been running.</li> </ul> <p>Notice that the name of the ReplicaSet is always formatted as <code>[DEPLOYMENT-NAME]-[RANDOM-STRING]</code>. The random string is randomly generated and uses the <code>pod-template-hash</code> as a seed.</p> </li> <li> <p>To see the labels automatically generated for each Pod, run <code>kubectl get pods --show-labels</code>. The output is similar to:</p> <pre><code>NAME                                READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE       LABELS

</pre>
<p>or use the following command:</p> <pre class="highlight" data-language="shell">kubectl set image deployment/nginx-deployment nginx=nginx:1.16.1
</pre>
<p>The output is similar to:</p> <pre><code>deployment.apps/nginx-deployment image updated

<p>or</p> <pre><code>deployment "nginx-deployment" successfully rolled out
</code></pre>
</li> </ol> <p>Get more details on your updated Deployment:</p> <ul> <li> <p>After the rollout succeeds, you can view the Deployment by running <code>kubectl get deployments</code>.

</pre>
</li> <li> <p>Run <code>kubectl get rs</code> to see that the Deployment updated the Pods by creating a new ReplicaSet and scaling it up to 3 replicas, as well as scaling down the old ReplicaSet to 0 replicas.</p> <pre class="highlight" data-language="shell">kubectl get rs

<p>Next time you want to update these Pods, you only need to update the Deployment's Pod template again.</p> <p>Deployment ensures that only a certain number of Pods are down while they are being updated. By default, it ensures that at least 75% of the desired number of Pods are up (25% max unavailable).</p> <p>Deployment also ensures that only a certain number of Pods are created above the desired number of Pods. By default, it ensures that at most 125% of the desired number of Pods are up (25% max surge).</p> <p>For example, if you look at the above Deployment closely, you will see that it first created a new Pod, then deleted some old Pods, and created new ones. It does not kill old Pods until a sufficient number of new Pods have come up, and does not create new Pods until a sufficient number of old Pods have been killed. It makes sure that at least 2 Pods are available and that at max 4 Pods in total are available.</p> </li> <li> <p>Get details of your Deployment:</p> <pre class="highlight" data-language="shell">kubectl describe deployments

</code></pre>
<p>Here you see that when you first created the Deployment, it created a ReplicaSet (nginx-deployment-2035384211) and scaled it up to 3 replicas directly. When you updated the Deployment, it created a new ReplicaSet (nginx-deployment-1564180365) and scaled it up to 1 and then scaled down the old ReplicaSet to 2, so that at least 2 Pods were available and at most 4 Pods were created at all times. It then continued scaling up and down the new and the old ReplicaSet, with the same rolling update strategy. Finally, you'll have 3 available replicas in the new ReplicaSet, and the old ReplicaSet is scaled down to 0.</p> </li> </ul> <h3 id="rollover-aka-multiple-updates-in-flight">Rollover (aka multiple updates in-flight)</h3> <p>Each time a new Deployment is observed by the Deployment controller, a ReplicaSet is created to bring up the desired Pods. If the Deployment is updated, the existing ReplicaSet that controls Pods whose labels match <code>.spec.selector</code> but whose template does not match <code>.spec.template</code> are scaled down. Eventually, the new ReplicaSet is scaled to <code>.spec.replicas</code> and all old ReplicaSets is scaled to 0.</p> <p>If you update a Deployment while an existing rollout is in progress, the Deployment creates a new ReplicaSet as per the update and start scaling that up, and rolls over the ReplicaSet that it was scaling up previously -- it will add it to its list of old ReplicaSets and start scaling it down.</p> <p>For example, suppose you create a Deployment to create 5 replicas of <code>nginx:1.14.2</code>, but then update the Deployment to create 5 replicas of <code>nginx:1.16.1</code>, when only 3 replicas of <code>nginx:1.14.2</code> had been created. In that case, the Deployment immediately starts killing the 3 <code>nginx:1.14.2</code> Pods that it had created, and starts creating <code>nginx:1.16.1</code> Pods. It does not wait for the 5 replicas of <code>nginx:1.14.2</code> to be created before changing course.</p> <h3 id="label-selector-updates">Label selector updates</h3> <p>It is generally discouraged to make label selector updates and it is suggested to plan your selectors up front. In any case, if you need to perform a label selector update, exercise great caution and make sure you have grasped all of the implications.</p> <div class="alert alert-info note callout" role="alert"> <strong>Note:</strong> In API version <code>apps/v1</code>, a Deployment's label selector is immutable after it gets created. </div> <ul> <li>Selector additions require the Pod template labels in the Deployment spec to be updated with the new label too, otherwise a validation error is returned. This change is a non-overlapping one, meaning that the new selector does not select ReplicaSets and Pods created with the old selector, resulting in orphaning all old ReplicaSets and creating a new ReplicaSet.</li> <li>Selector updates changes the existing value in a selector key -- result in the same behavior as additions.</li> <li>Selector removals removes an existing key from the Deployment selector -- do not require any changes in the Pod template labels. Existing ReplicaSets are not orphaned, and a new ReplicaSet is not created, but note that the removed label still exists in any existing Pods and ReplicaSets.</li> </ul> <h2 id="rolling-back-a-deployment">Rolling Back a Deployment</h2> <p>Sometimes, you may want to rollback a Deployment; for example, when the Deployment is not stable, such as crash looping. By default, all of the Deployment's rollout history is kept in the system so that you can rollback anytime you want (you can change that by modifying revision history limit).</p> <div class="alert alert-info note callout" role="alert"> <strong>Note:</strong> A Deployment's revision is created when a Deployment's rollout is triggered. This means that the new revision is created if and only if the Deployment's Pod template (<code>.spec.template</code>) is changed, for example if you update the labels or container images of the template. Other updates, such as scaling the Deployment, do not create a Deployment revision, so that you can facilitate simultaneous manual- or auto-scaling. This means that when you roll back to an earlier revision, only the Deployment's Pod template part is rolled back. </div> <ul> <li> <p>Suppose that you made a typo while updating the Deployment, by putting the image name as <code>nginx:1.161</code> instead of <code>nginx:1.16.1</code>:</p> <pre class="highlight" data-language="shell">kubectl set image deployment/nginx-deployment nginx=nginx:1.161 
</pre>
<p>The output is similar to this:</p> <pre><code>deployment.apps/nginx-deployment image updated
</code></pre>
</li> <li> <p>The rollout gets stuck. You can verify it by checking the rollout status:</p> <pre class="highlight" data-language="shell">kubectl rollout status deployment/nginx-deployment
</pre>
<p>The output is similar to this:</p> <pre><code>Waiting for rollout to finish: 1 out of 3 new replicas have been updated...
</code></pre>
</li> <li> <p>Press Ctrl-C to stop the above rollout status watch. For more information on stuck rollouts, <a href="#deployment-status">read more here</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>You see that the number of old replicas (<code>nginx-deployment-1564180365</code> and <code>nginx-deployment-2035384211</code>) is 2, and new replicas (nginx-deployment-3066724191) is 1.</p> <pre class="highlight" data-language="shell">kubectl get rs

</li> </ol> <h2 id="scaling-a-deployment">Scaling a Deployment</h2> <p>You can scale a Deployment by using the following command:</p> <pre class="highlight" data-language="shell">kubectl scale deployment/nginx-deployment --replicas=10
</pre>
<p>The output is similar to this:</p> <pre><code>deployment.apps/nginx-deployment scaled
</code></pre>
<p>Assuming <a href="../../../tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale-walkthrough/index">horizontal Pod autoscaling</a> is enabled in your cluster, you can setup an autoscaler for your Deployment and choose the minimum and maximum number of Pods you want to run based on the CPU utilization of your existing Pods.</p> <pre class="highlight" data-language="shell">kubectl autoscale deployment/nginx-deployment --min=10 --max=15 --cpu-percent=80

<p>The output is similar to this:</p> <pre><code>deployment.apps/nginx-deployment scaled
</code></pre>
<h3 id="proportional-scaling">Proportional scaling</h3> <p>RollingUpdate Deployments support running multiple versions of an application at the same time. When you or an autoscaler scales a RollingUpdate Deployment that is in the middle of a rollout (either in progress or paused), the Deployment controller balances the additional replicas in the existing active ReplicaSets (ReplicaSets with Pods) in order to mitigate risk. This is called <em>proportional scaling</em>.</p> <p>For example, you are running a Deployment with 10 replicas, <a href="#max-surge">maxSurge</a>=3, and <a href="#max-unavailable">maxUnavailable</a>=2.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Ensure that the 10 replicas in your Deployment are running.</p> <pre class="highlight" data-language="shell">kubectl get deploy
</pre>
<p>The output is similar to this:</p> <pre><code>NAME                 DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
nginx-deployment     10        10        10           10          50s
</code></pre>
</li> <li> <p>You update to a new image which happens to be unresolvable from inside the cluster.</p> <pre class="highlight" data-language="shell">kubectl set image deployment/nginx-deployment nginx=nginx:sometag
</pre>
<p>The output is similar to this:</p> <pre><code>deployment.apps/nginx-deployment image updated
</code></pre>
</li> <li> <p>The image update starts a new rollout with ReplicaSet nginx-deployment-1989198191, but it's blocked due to the <code>maxUnavailable</code> requirement that you mentioned above. Check out the rollout status:</p> <pre class="highlight" data-language="shell">kubectl get rs
</pre>
<pre><code>The output is similar to this:
</code></pre> <pre><code>NAME                          DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
nginx-deployment-1989198191   5         5         0         9s
nginx-deployment-618515232    8         8         8         1m
</code></pre>
</li> <li> <p>Then a new scaling request for the Deployment comes along. The autoscaler increments the Deployment replicas to 15. The Deployment controller needs to decide where to add these new 5 replicas. If you weren't using proportional scaling, all 5 of them would be added in the new ReplicaSet. With proportional scaling, you spread the additional replicas across all ReplicaSets. Bigger proportions go to the ReplicaSets with the most replicas and lower proportions go to ReplicaSets with less replicas. Any leftovers are added to the ReplicaSet with the most replicas. ReplicaSets with zero replicas are not scaled up.</p> </li> </ul> <p>In our example above, 3 replicas are added to the old ReplicaSet and 2 replicas are added to the new ReplicaSet. The rollout process should eventually move all replicas to the new ReplicaSet, assuming the new replicas become healthy. To confirm this, run:</p> <pre class="highlight" data-language="shell">kubectl get deploy
</pre>
<p>The output is similar to this:</p> <pre><code>NAME                 DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE

<p>and the exit status from <code>kubectl rollout</code> is 0 (success):</p> <pre class="highlight" data-language="shell">echo $?
</pre>
<pre><code>0
</code></pre>
<h3 id="failed-deployment">Failed Deployment</h3> <p>Your Deployment may get stuck trying to deploy its newest ReplicaSet without ever completing. This can occur due to some of the following factors:</p> <ul> <li>Insufficient quota</li> <li>Readiness probe failures</li> <li>Image pull errors</li> <li>Insufficient permissions</li> <li>Limit ranges</li> <li>Application runtime misconfiguration</li> </ul> <p>One way you can detect this condition is to specify a deadline parameter in your Deployment spec: (<a href="#progress-deadline-seconds"><code>.spec.progressDeadlineSeconds</code></a>). <code>.spec.progressDeadlineSeconds</code> denotes the number of seconds the Deployment controller waits before indicating (in the Deployment status) that the Deployment progress has stalled.</p> <p>The following <code>kubectl</code> command sets the spec with <code>progressDeadlineSeconds</code> to make the controller report lack of progress for a Deployment after 10 minutes:</p> <pre class="highlight" data-language="shell">kubectl patch deployment/nginx-deployment -p '{"spec":{"progressDeadlineSeconds":600}}'
</pre>
<p>The output is similar to this:</p> <pre><code>deployment.apps/nginx-deployment patched
</code></pre>
<p>Once the deadline has been exceeded, the Deployment controller adds a DeploymentCondition with the following attributes to the Deployment's <code>.status.conditions</code>:</p> <ul> <li>Type=Progressing</li> <li>Status=False</li> <li>Reason=ProgressDeadlineExceeded</li> </ul> <p>See the <a href="https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#typical-status-properties">Kubernetes API conventions</a> for more information on status conditions.</p> <div class="alert alert-info note callout" role="alert"> <strong>Note:</strong> Kubernetes takes no action on a stalled Deployment other than to report a status condition with <code>Reason=ProgressDeadlineExceeded</code>. Higher level orchestrators can take advantage of it and act accordingly, for example, rollback the Deployment to its previous version. </div> <div class="alert alert-info note callout" role="alert"> <strong>Note:</strong> If you pause a Deployment rollout, Kubernetes does not check progress against your specified deadline. You can safely pause a Deployment rollout in the middle of a rollout and resume without triggering the condition for exceeding the deadline. </div> <p>You may experience transient errors with your Deployments, either due to a low timeout that you have set or due to any other kind of error that can be treated as transient. For example, let's suppose you have insufficient quota. If you describe the Deployment you will notice the following section:</p> <pre class="highlight" data-language="shell">kubectl describe deployment nginx-deployment
</pre>
<p>The output is similar to this:</p> <pre><code>&lt;...&gt;
Conditions:
  Type            Status  Reason
  ----            ------  ------
  Available       True    MinimumReplicasAvailable
  Progressing     True    ReplicaSetUpdated
  ReplicaFailure  True    FailedCreate
&lt;...&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>If you run <code>kubectl get deployment nginx-deployment -o yaml</code>, the Deployment status is similar to this:</p> <pre><code>status:
  availableReplicas: 2
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: 2016-10-04T12:25:39Z
    lastUpdateTime: 2016-10-04T12:25:39Z
    message: Replica set "nginx-deployment-4262182780" is progressing.
    reason: ReplicaSetUpdated
    status: "True"
    type: Progressing
  - lastTransitionTime: 2016-10-04T12:25:42Z
    lastUpdateTime: 2016-10-04T12:25:42Z
    message: Deployment has minimum availability.
    reason: MinimumReplicasAvailable
    status: "True"
    type: Available
  - lastTransitionTime: 2016-10-04T12:25:39Z
    lastUpdateTime: 2016-10-04T12:25:39Z
    message: 'Error creating: pods "nginx-deployment-4262182780-" is forbidden: exceeded quota:
      object-counts, requested: pods=1, used: pods=3, limited: pods=2'
    reason: FailedCreate
    status: "True"
    type: ReplicaFailure
  observedGeneration: 3
  replicas: 2
  unavailableReplicas: 2
</code></pre>
<p>Eventually, once the Deployment progress deadline is exceeded, Kubernetes updates the status and the reason for the Progressing condition:</p> <pre><code>Conditions:
  Type            Status  Reason
  ----            ------  ------
  Available       True    MinimumReplicasAvailable
  Progressing     False   ProgressDeadlineExceeded
  ReplicaFailure  True    FailedCreate
</code></pre>
<p>You can address an issue of insufficient quota by scaling down your Deployment, by scaling down other controllers you may be running, or by increasing quota in your namespace. If you satisfy the quota conditions and the Deployment controller then completes the Deployment rollout, you'll see the Deployment's status update with a successful condition (<code>Status=True</code> and <code>Reason=NewReplicaSetAvailable</code>).</p> <pre><code>Conditions:
  Type          Status  Reason
  ----          ------  ------
  Available     True    MinimumReplicasAvailable
  Progressing   True    NewReplicaSetAvailable
</code></pre>
<p><code>Type=Available</code> with <code>Status=True</code> means that your Deployment has minimum availability. Minimum availability is dictated by the parameters specified in the deployment strategy. <code>Type=Progressing</code> with <code>Status=True</code> means that your Deployment is either in the middle of a rollout and it is progressing or that it has successfully completed its progress and the minimum required new replicas are available (see the Reason of the condition for the particulars - in our case <code>Reason=NewReplicaSetAvailable</code> means that the Deployment is complete).</p> <p>You can check if a Deployment has failed to progress by using <code>kubectl rollout status</code>. <code>kubectl rollout status</code> returns a non-zero exit code if the Deployment has exceeded the progression deadline.</p> <pre class="highlight" data-language="shell">kubectl rollout status deployment/nginx-deployment
</pre>
<p>The output is similar to this:</p> <pre><code>Waiting for rollout to finish: 2 out of 3 new replicas have been updated...
error: deployment "nginx" exceeded its progress deadline
</code></pre>
<p>and the exit status from <code>kubectl rollout</code> is 1 (indicating an error):</p> <pre class="highlight" data-language="shell">echo $?
</pre>
<pre><code>1
</code></pre>
<h3 id="operating-on-a-failed-deployment">Operating on a failed deployment</h3> <p>All actions that apply to a complete Deployment also apply to a failed Deployment. You can scale it up/down, roll back to a previous revision, or even pause it if you need to apply multiple tweaks in the Deployment Pod template.</p> <h2 id="clean-up-policy">Clean up Policy</h2> <p>You can set <code>.spec.revisionHistoryLimit</code> field in a Deployment to specify how many old ReplicaSets for this Deployment you want to retain. The rest will be garbage-collected in the background. By default, it is 10.</p> <div class="alert alert-info note callout" role="alert"> <strong>Note:</strong> Explicitly setting this field to 0, will result in cleaning up all the history of your Deployment thus that Deployment will not be able to roll back. </div> <h2 id="canary-deployment">Canary Deployment</h2> <p>If you want to roll out releases to a subset of users or servers using the Deployment, you can create multiple Deployments, one for each release, following the canary pattern described in <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/manage-deployment/#canary-deployments">managing resources</a>.</p> <h2 id="writing-a-deployment-spec">Writing a Deployment Spec</h2> <p>As with all other Kubernetes configs, a Deployment needs <code>.apiVersion</code>, <code>.kind</code>, and <code>.metadata</code> fields. For general information about working with config files, see <a href="../../../tasks/run-application/run-stateless-application-deployment/index">deploying applications</a>, configuring containers, and <a href="../../overview/working-with-objects/object-management/index">using kubectl to manage resources</a> documents. The name of a Deployment object must be a valid <a href="../../overview/working-with-objects/names#dns-subdomain-names">DNS subdomain name</a>.</p> <p>A Deployment also needs a <a href="https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#spec-and-status"><code>.spec</code> section</a>.</p> <h3 id="pod-template">Pod Template</h3> <p>The <code>.spec.template</code> and <code>.spec.selector</code> are the only required fields of the <code>.spec</code>.</p> <p>The <code>.spec.template</code> is a <a href="../pods/index#pod-templates">Pod template</a>. It has exactly the same schema as a <a class="glossary-tooltip" title="A Pod represents a set of running containers in your cluster." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../pods/index" target="_blank" aria-label="Pod">Pod</a>, except it is nested and does not have an <code>apiVersion</code> or <code>kind</code>.</p> <p>In addition to required fields for a Pod, a Pod template in a Deployment must specify appropriate labels and an appropriate restart policy. For labels, make sure not to overlap with other controllers. See <a href="#selector">selector</a>.</p> <p>Only a <a href="../pods/pod-lifecycle/index#restart-policy"><code>.spec.template.spec.restartPolicy</code></a> equal to <code>Always</code> is allowed, which is the default if not specified.</p> <h3 id="replicas">Replicas</h3> <p><code>.spec.replicas</code> is an optional field that specifies the number of desired Pods. It defaults to 1.</p> <p>Should you manually scale a Deployment, example via <code>kubectl scale deployment deployment --replicas=X</code>, and then you update that Deployment based on a manifest (for example: by running <code>kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml</code>), then applying that manifest overwrites the manual scaling that you previously did.</p> <p>If a <a href="../../../tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/index">HorizontalPodAutoscaler</a> (or any similar API for horizontal scaling) is managing scaling for a Deployment, don't set <code>.spec.replicas</code>.</p> <p>Instead, allow the Kubernetes <a class="glossary-tooltip" title="The container orchestration layer that exposes the API and interfaces to define, deploy, and manage the lifecycle of containers." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/glossary/?all=true#term-control-plane" target="_blank" aria-label="control plane">control plane</a> to manage the <code>.spec.replicas</code> field automatically.</p> <h3 id="selector">Selector</h3> <p><code>.spec.selector</code> is a required field that specifies a <a href="../../overview/working-with-objects/labels/index">label selector</a> for the Pods targeted by this Deployment.</p> <p><code>.spec.selector</code> must match <code>.spec.template.metadata.labels</code>, or it will be rejected by the API.</p> <p>In API version <code>apps/v1</code>, <code>.spec.selector</code> and <code>.metadata.labels</code> do not default to <code>.spec.template.metadata.labels</code> if not set. So they must be set explicitly. Also note that <code>.spec.selector</code> is immutable after creation of the Deployment in <code>apps/v1</code>.</p> <p>A Deployment may terminate Pods whose labels match the selector if their template is different from <code>.spec.template</code> or if the total number of such Pods exceeds <code>.spec.replicas</code>. It brings up new Pods with <code>.spec.template</code> if the number of Pods is less than the desired number.</p> <div class="alert alert-info note callout" role="alert"> <strong>Note:</strong> You should not create other Pods whose labels match this selector, either directly, by creating another Deployment, or by creating another controller such as a ReplicaSet or a ReplicationController. If you do so, the first Deployment thinks that it created these other Pods. Kubernetes does not stop you from doing this. </div> <p>If you have multiple controllers that have overlapping selectors, the controllers will fight with each other and won't behave correctly.</p> <h3 id="strategy">Strategy</h3> <p><code>.spec.strategy</code> specifies the strategy used to replace old Pods by new ones. <code>.spec.strategy.type</code> can be "Recreate" or "RollingUpdate". "RollingUpdate" is the default value.</p> <h4 id="recreate-deployment">Recreate Deployment</h4> <p>All existing Pods are killed before new ones are created when <code>.spec.strategy.type==Recreate</code>.</p> <div class="alert alert-info note callout" role="alert"> <strong>Note:</strong> This will only guarantee Pod termination previous to creation for upgrades. If you upgrade a Deployment, all Pods of the old revision will be terminated immediately. Successful removal is awaited before any Pod of the new revision is created. If you manually delete a Pod, the lifecycle is controlled by the ReplicaSet and the replacement will be created immediately (even if the old Pod is still in a Terminating state). If you need an "at most" guarantee for your Pods, you should consider using a <a href="statefulset/index">StatefulSet</a>. </div> <h4 id="rolling-update-deployment">Rolling Update Deployment</h4> <p>The Deployment updates Pods in a rolling update fashion when <code>.spec.strategy.type==RollingUpdate</code>. You can specify <code>maxUnavailable</code> and <code>maxSurge</code> to control the rolling update process.</p> <h5 id="max-unavailable">Max Unavailable</h5> <p><code>.spec.strategy.rollingUpdate.maxUnavailable</code> is an optional field that specifies the maximum number of Pods that can be unavailable during the update process. The value can be an absolute number (for example, 5) or a percentage of desired Pods (for example, 10%). The absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding down. The value cannot be 0 if <code>.spec.strategy.rollingUpdate.maxSurge</code> is 0. The default value is 25%.</p> <p>For example, when this value is set to 30%, the old ReplicaSet can be scaled down to 70% of desired Pods immediately when the rolling update starts. Once new Pods are ready, old ReplicaSet can be scaled down further, followed by scaling up the new ReplicaSet, ensuring that the total number of Pods available at all times during the update is at least 70% of the desired Pods.</p> <h5 id="max-surge">Max Surge</h5> <p><code>.spec.strategy.rollingUpdate.maxSurge</code> is an optional field that specifies the maximum number of Pods that can be created over the desired number of Pods. The value can be an absolute number (for example, 5) or a percentage of desired Pods (for example, 10%). The value cannot be 0 if <code>MaxUnavailable</code> is 0. The absolute number is calculated from the percentage by rounding up. The default value is 25%.</p> <p>For example, when this value is set to 30%, the new ReplicaSet can be scaled up immediately when the rolling update starts, such that the total number of old and new Pods does not exceed 130% of desired Pods. Once old Pods have been killed, the new ReplicaSet can be scaled up further, ensuring that the total number of Pods running at any time during the update is at most 130% of desired Pods.</p> <h3 id="progress-deadline-seconds">Progress Deadline Seconds</h3> <p><code>.spec.progressDeadlineSeconds</code> is an optional field that specifies the number of seconds you want to wait for your Deployment to progress before the system reports back that the Deployment has <a href="#failed-deployment">failed progressing</a> - surfaced as a condition with <code>Type=Progressing</code>, <code>Status=False</code>. and <code>Reason=ProgressDeadlineExceeded</code> in the status of the resource. The Deployment controller will keep retrying the Deployment. This defaults to 600. In the future, once automatic rollback will be implemented, the Deployment controller will roll back a Deployment as soon as it observes such a condition.</p> <p>If specified, this field needs to be greater than <code>.spec.minReadySeconds</code>.</p> <h3 id="min-ready-seconds">Min Ready Seconds</h3> <p><code>.spec.minReadySeconds</code> is an optional field that specifies the minimum number of seconds for which a newly created Pod should be ready without any of its containers crashing, for it to be considered available. This defaults to 0 (the Pod will be considered available as soon as it is ready). To learn more about when a Pod is considered ready, see <a href="../pods/pod-lifecycle/index#container-probes">Container Probes</a>.</p> <h3 id="revision-history-limit">Revision History Limit</h3> <p>A Deployment's revision history is stored in the ReplicaSets it controls.</p> <p><code>.spec.revisionHistoryLimit</code> is an optional field that specifies the number of old ReplicaSets to retain to allow rollback. These old ReplicaSets consume resources in <code>etcd</code> and crowd the output of <code>kubectl get rs</code>. The configuration of each Deployment revision is stored in its ReplicaSets; therefore, once an old ReplicaSet is deleted, you lose the ability to rollback to that revision of Deployment. By default, 10 old ReplicaSets will be kept, however its ideal value depends on the frequency and stability of new Deployments.</p> <p>More specifically, setting this field to zero means that all old ReplicaSets with 0 replicas will be cleaned up. In this case, a new Deployment rollout cannot be undone, since its revision history is cleaned up.</p> <h3 id="paused">Paused</h3> <p><code>.spec.paused</code> is an optional boolean field for pausing and resuming a Deployment. The only difference between a paused Deployment and one that is not paused, is that any changes into the PodTemplateSpec of the paused Deployment will not trigger new rollouts as long as it is paused. A Deployment is not paused by default when it is created.</p> <h2 id="what-s-next">What's next</h2> <ul> <li>Learn about <a href="../pods">Pods</a>.</li> <li>
