<h1>Jobs</h1>  <p>A Job creates one or more Pods and will continue to retry execution of the Pods until a specified number of them successfully terminate. As pods successfully complete, the Job tracks the successful completions. When a specified number of successful completions is reached, the task (ie, Job) is complete. Deleting a Job will clean up the Pods it created. Suspending a Job will delete its active Pods until the Job is resumed again.</p> <p>A simple case is to create one Job object in order to reliably run one Pod to completion. The Job object will start a new Pod if the first Pod fails or is deleted (for example due to a node hardware failure or a node reboot).</p> <p>You can also use a Job to run multiple Pods in parallel.</p> <p>If you want to run a Job (either a single task, or several in parallel) on a schedule, see <a href="../cron-jobs/index">CronJob</a>.</p>  <h2 id="running-an-example-job">Running an example Job</h2> <p>Here is an example Job config.

</pre></div>
<h2 id="writing-a-job-spec">Writing a Job spec</h2> <p>As with all other Kubernetes config, a Job needs <code>apiVersion</code>, <code>kind</code>, and <code>metadata</code> fields. Its name must be a valid <a href="../../../overview/working-with-objects/names/index#dns-subdomain-names">DNS subdomain name</a>.</p> <p>A Job also needs a <a href="https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#spec-and-status"><code>.spec</code> section</a>.</p> <h3 id="pod-template">Pod Template</h3> <p>The <code>.spec.template</code> is the only required field of the <code>.spec</code>.</p> <p>The <code>.spec.template</code> is a <a href="../../pods/index#pod-templates">pod template</a>. It has exactly the same schema as a <a class="glossary-tooltip" title="A Pod represents a set of running containers in your cluster." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../../pods/index" target="_blank" aria-label="Pod">Pod</a>, except it is nested and does not have an <code>apiVersion</code> or <code>kind</code>.</p> <p>In addition to required fields for a Pod, a pod template in a Job must specify appropriate labels (see <a href="#pod-selector">pod selector</a>) and an appropriate restart policy.</p> <p>Only a <a href="../../pods/pod-lifecycle/index#restart-policy"><code>RestartPolicy</code></a> equal to <code>Never</code> or <code>OnFailure</code> is allowed.</p> <h3 id="pod-selector">Pod selector</h3> <p>The <code>.spec.selector</code> field is optional. In almost all cases you should not specify it. See section <a href="#specifying-your-own-pod-selector">specifying your own pod selector</a>.</p> <h3 id="parallel-jobs">Parallel execution for Jobs</h3> <p>There are three main types of task suitable to run as a Job:</p> <ol> <li>Non-parallel Jobs <ul> <li>normally, only one Pod is started, unless the Pod fails.</li> <li>the Job is complete as soon as its Pod terminates successfully.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Parallel Jobs with a <em>fixed completion count</em>: <ul> <li>specify a non-zero positive value for <code>.spec.completions</code>.</li> <li>the Job represents the overall task, and is complete when there are <code>.spec.completions</code> successful Pods.</li> <li>when using <code>.spec.completionMode="Indexed"</code>, each Pod gets a different index in the range 0 to <code>.spec.completions-1</code>.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Parallel Jobs with a <em>work queue</em>: <ul> <li>do not specify <code>.spec.completions</code>, default to <code>.spec.parallelism</code>.</li> <li>the Pods must coordinate amongst themselves or an external service to determine what each should work on. For example, a Pod might fetch a batch of up to N items from the work queue.</li> <li>each Pod is independently capable of determining whether or not all its peers are done, and thus that the entire Job is done.</li> <li>when <em>any</em> Pod from the Job terminates with success, no new Pods are created.</li> <li>once at least one Pod has terminated with success and all Pods are terminated, then the Job is completed with success.</li> <li>once any Pod has exited with success, no other Pod should still be doing any work for this task or writing any output. They should all be in the process of exiting.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>For a <em>non-parallel</em> Job, you can leave both <code>.spec.completions</code> and <code>.spec.parallelism</code> unset. When both are unset, both are defaulted to 1.</p> <p>For a <em>fixed completion count</em> Job, you should set <code>.spec.completions</code> to the number of completions needed. You can set <code>.spec.parallelism</code>, or leave it unset and it will default to 1.</p> <p>For a <em>work queue</em> Job, you must leave <code>.spec.completions</code> unset, and set <code>.spec.parallelism</code> to a non-negative integer.</p> <p>For more information about how to make use of the different types of job, see the <a href="#job-patterns">job patterns</a> section.</p> <h4 id="controlling-parallelism">Controlling parallelism</h4> <p>The requested parallelism (<code>.spec.parallelism</code>) can be set to any non-negative value. If it is unspecified, it defaults to 1. If it is specified as 0, then the Job is effectively paused until it is increased.</p> <p>Actual parallelism (number of pods running at any instant) may be more or less than requested parallelism, for a variety of reasons:</p> <ul> <li>For <em>fixed completion count</em> Jobs, the actual number of pods running in parallel will not exceed the number of remaining completions. Higher values of <code>.spec.parallelism</code> are effectively ignored.</li> <li>For <em>work queue</em> Jobs, no new Pods are started after any Pod has succeeded -- remaining Pods are allowed to complete, however.</li> <li>If the Job <a class="glossary-tooltip" title="A control loop that watches the shared state of the cluster through the apiserver and makes changes attempting to move the current state towards the desired state." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../../../architecture/controller/index" target="_blank" aria-label="Controller">Controller</a> has not had time to react.</li> <li>If the Job controller failed to create Pods for any reason (lack of <code>ResourceQuota</code>, lack of permission, etc.), then there may be fewer pods than requested.</li> <li>The Job controller may throttle new Pod creation due to excessive previous pod failures in the same Job.</li> <li>When a Pod is gracefully shut down, it takes time to stop.</li> </ul> <h3 id="completion-mode">Completion mode</h3> <div style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"> <b>FEATURE STATE:</b> <code>Kubernetes v1.22 [beta]</code> </div> <p>Jobs with <em>fixed completion count</em> - that is, jobs that have non null <code>.spec.completions</code> - can have a completion mode that is specified in <code>.spec.completionMode</code>:</p> <ul> <li> <p><code>NonIndexed</code> (default): the Job is considered complete when there have been <code>.spec.completions</code> successfully completed Pods. In other words, each Pod completion is homologous to each other. Note that Jobs that have null <code>.spec.completions</code> are implicitly <code>NonIndexed</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>Indexed</code>: the Pods of a Job get an associated completion index from 0 to <code>.spec.completions-1</code>. The index is available through three mechanisms:</p> <ul> <li>The Pod annotation <code>batch.kubernetes.io/job-completion-index</code>.</li> <li>As part of the Pod hostname, following the pattern <code>$(job-name)-$(index)</code>. When you use an Indexed Job in combination with a <a class="glossary-tooltip" title="A way to expose an application running on a set of Pods as a network service." data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="../../../services-networking/service/index" target="_blank" aria-label="Service">Service</a>, Pods within the Job can use the deterministic hostnames to address each other via DNS.</li> <li>From the containarized task, in the environment variable <code>JOB_COMPLETION_INDEX</code>.</li> </ul> <p>The Job is considered complete when there is one successfully completed Pod for each index. For more information about how to use this mode, see <a href="../../../../tasks/job/indexed-parallel-processing-static/index">Indexed Job for Parallel Processing with Static Work Assignment</a>. Note that, although rare, more than one Pod could be started for the same index, but only one of them will count towards the completion count.</p> </li> </ul> <h2 id="handling-pod-and-container-failures">Handling Pod and container failures</h2> <p>A container in a Pod may fail for a number of reasons, such as because the process in it exited with a non-zero exit code, or the container was killed for exceeding a memory limit, etc. If this happens, and the <code>.spec.template.spec.restartPolicy = "OnFailure"</code>, then the Pod stays on the node, but the container is re-run. Therefore, your program needs to handle the case when it is restarted locally, or else specify <code>.spec.template.spec.restartPolicy = "Never"</code>. See <a href="../../pods/pod-lifecycle/index#example-states">pod lifecycle</a> for more information on <code>restartPolicy</code>.</p> <p>An entire Pod can also fail, for a number of reasons, such as when the pod is kicked off the node (node is upgraded, rebooted, deleted, etc.), or if a container of the Pod fails and the <code>.spec.template.spec.restartPolicy = "Never"</code>. When a Pod fails, then the Job controller starts a new Pod. This means that your application needs to handle the case when it is restarted in a new pod. In particular, it needs to handle temporary files, locks, incomplete output and the like caused by previous runs.</p> <p>Note that even if you specify <code>.spec.parallelism = 1</code> and <code>.spec.completions = 1</code> and <code>.spec.template.spec.restartPolicy = "Never"</code>, the same program may sometimes be started twice.</p> <p>If you do specify <code>.spec.parallelism</code> and <code>.spec.completions</code> both greater than 1, then there may be multiple pods running at once. Therefore, your pods must also be tolerant of concurrency.</p> <h3 id="pod-backoff-failure-policy">Pod backoff failure policy</h3> <p>There are situations where you want to fail a Job after some amount of retries due to a logical error in configuration etc. To do so, set <code>.spec.backoffLimit</code> to specify the number of retries before considering a Job as failed. The back-off limit is set by default to 6. Failed Pods associated with the Job are recreated by the Job controller with an exponential back-off delay (10s, 20s, 40s ...) capped at six minutes. The back-off count is reset when a Job's Pod is deleted or successful without any other Pods for the Job failing around that time.</p> <div class="alert alert-info note callout" role="alert"> <strong>Note:</strong> If your job has <code>restartPolicy = "OnFailure"</code>, keep in mind that your Pod running the Job will be terminated once the job backoff limit has been reached. This can make debugging the Job's executable more difficult. We suggest setting <code>restartPolicy = "Never"</code> when debugging the Job or using a logging system to ensure output from failed Jobs is not lost inadvertently. </div> <h2 id="job-termination-and-cleanup">Job termination and cleanup</h2> <p>When a Job completes, no more Pods are created, but the Pods are <a href="#pod-backoff-failure-policy">usually</a> not deleted either. Keeping them around allows you to still view the logs of completed pods to check for errors, warnings, or other diagnostic output. The job object also remains after it is completed so that you can view its status. It is up to the user to delete old jobs after noting their status. Delete the job with <code>kubectl</code> (e.g. <code>kubectl delete jobs/pi</code> or <code>kubectl delete -f ./job.yaml</code>). When you delete the job using <code>kubectl</code>, all the pods it created are deleted too.</p> <p>By default, a Job will run uninterrupted unless a Pod fails (<code>restartPolicy=Never</code>) or a Container exits in error (<code>restartPolicy=OnFailure</code>), at which point the Job defers to the <code>.spec.backoffLimit</code> described above. Once <code>.spec.backoffLimit</code> has been reached the Job will be marked as failed and any running Pods will be terminated.</p> <p>Another way to terminate a Job is by setting an active deadline. Do this by setting the <code>.spec.activeDeadlineSeconds</code> field of the Job to a number of seconds. The <code>activeDeadlineSeconds</code> applies to the duration of the job, no matter how many Pods are created. Once a Job reaches <code>activeDeadlineSeconds</code>, all of its running Pods are terminated and the Job status will become <code>type: Failed</code> with <code>reason: DeadlineExceeded</code>.</p> <p>Note that a Job's <code>.spec.activeDeadlineSeconds</code> takes precedence over its <code>.spec.backoffLimit</code>. Therefore, a Job that is retrying one or more failed Pods will not deploy additional Pods once it reaches the time limit specified by <code>activeDeadlineSeconds</code>, even if the <code>backoffLimit</code> is not yet reached.</p> <p>Example:</p> <div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4" data-language="yaml">apiVersion: batch/v1

<p>Note that both the Job spec and the <a href="../../pods/init-containers/index#detailed-behavior">Pod template spec</a> within the Job have an <code>activeDeadlineSeconds</code> field. Ensure that you set this field at the proper level.</p> <p>Keep in mind that the <code>restartPolicy</code> applies to the Pod, and not to the Job itself: there is no automatic Job restart once the Job status is <code>type: Failed</code>.

The Job object is not designed to support closely-communicating parallel processes, as commonly found in scientific computing. It does support parallel processing of a set of independent but related <em>work items</em>. These might be emails to be sent, frames to be rendered, files to be transcoded, ranges of keys in a NoSQL database to scan, and so on.</p> <p>In a complex system, there may be multiple different sets of work items. Here we are just considering one set of work items that the user wants to manage together â€” a <em>batch job</em>.</p> <p>There are several different patterns for parallel computation, each with strengths and weaknesses. The tradeoffs are:</p> <ul> <li>One Job object for each work item, vs. a single Job object for all work items. The latter is better for large numbers of work items. The former creates some overhead for the user and for the system to manage large numbers of Job objects.</li> <li>Number of pods created equals number of work items, vs. each Pod can process multiple work items. The former typically requires less modification to existing code and containers. The latter is better for large numbers of work items, for similar reasons to the previous bullet.</li> <li>Several approaches use a work queue. This requires running a queue service, and modifications to the existing program or container to make it use the work queue. Other approaches are easier to adapt to an existing containerised application.</li> </ul> <p>The tradeoffs are summarized here, with columns 2 to 4 corresponding to the above tradeoffs. The pattern names are also links to examples and more detailed description.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Pattern</th> <th style="text-align:center">Single Job object</th> <th style="text-align:center">Fewer pods than work items?</th> <th style="text-align:center">Use app unmodified?</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><a href="../../../../tasks/job/coarse-parallel-processing-work-queue/index">Queue with Pod Per Work Item</a></td> <td style="text-align:center">âœ“</td> <td style="text-align:center"></td> <td style="text-align:center">sometimes</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a href="../../../../tasks/job/fine-parallel-processing-work-queue/index">Queue with Variable Pod Count</a></td> <td style="text-align:center">âœ“</td> <td style="text-align:center">âœ“</td> <td style="text-align:center"></td> </tr> <tr> <td><a href="../../../../tasks/job/indexed-parallel-processing-static/index">Indexed Job with Static Work Assignment</a></td> <td style="text-align:center">âœ“</td> <td style="text-align:center"></td> <td style="text-align:center">âœ“</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a href="../../../../tasks/job/parallel-processing-expansion/index">Job Template Expansion</a></td> <td style="text-align:center"></td> <td style="text-align:center"></td> <td style="text-align:center">âœ“</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>When you specify completions with <code>.spec.completions</code>, each Pod created by the Job controller has an identical <a href="https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#spec-and-status"><code>spec</code></a>.

However, you may want to temporarily suspend a Job's execution and resume it later, or start Jobs in suspended state and have a custom controller decide later when to start them.</p> <p>To suspend a Job, you can update the <code>.spec.suspend</code> field of the Job to true; later, when you want to resume it again, update it to false. Creating a Job with <code>.spec.suspend</code> set to true will create it in the suspended state.</p> <p>When a Job is resumed from suspension, its <code>.status.startTime</code> field will be reset to the current time.

<p>The last four events, particularly the "Suspended" and "Resumed" events, are directly a result of toggling the <code>.spec.suspend</code> field.

It is enabled by default. </div> <p>In most cases a parallel job will want the pods to run with constraints, like all in the same zone, or all either on GPU model x or y but not a mix of both.</p> <p>The <a href="#suspending-a-job">suspend</a> field is the first step towards achieving those semantics. Suspend allows a custom queue controller to decide when a job should start; However, once a job is unsuspended, a custom queue controller has no influence on where the pods of a job will actually land.</p> <p>This feature allows updating a Job's scheduling directives before it starts, which gives custom queue controllers the ability to influence pod placement while at the same time offloading actual pod-to-node assignment to kube-scheduler. This is allowed only for suspended Jobs that have never been unsuspended before.</p> <p>The fields in a Job's pod template that can be updated are node affinity, node selector, tolerations, labels and annotations.</p> <h3 id="specifying-your-own-pod-selector">Specifying your own Pod selector</h3> <p>Normally, when you create a Job object, you do not specify <code>.spec.selector</code>. The system defaulting logic adds this field when the Job is created. It picks a selector value that will not overlap with any other jobs.</p> <p>However, in some cases, you might need to override this automatically set selector. To do this, you can specify the <code>.spec.selector</code> of the Job.</p> <p>Be very careful when doing this. If you specify a label selector which is not unique to the pods of that Job, and which matches unrelated Pods, then pods of the unrelated job may be deleted, or this Job may count other Pods as completing it, or one or both Jobs may refuse to create Pods or run to completion. If a non-unique selector is chosen, then other controllers (e.g. ReplicationController) and their Pods may behave in unpredictable ways too. Kubernetes will not stop you from making a mistake when specifying <code>.spec.selector</code>.</p> <p>Here is an example of a case when you might want to use this feature.</p> <p>Say Job <code>old</code> is already running. You want existing Pods to keep running, but you want the rest of the Pods it creates to use a different pod template and for the Job to have a new name. You cannot update the Job because these fields are not updatable. Therefore, you delete Job <code>old</code> but <em>leave its pods running</em>, using <code>kubectl delete jobs/old --cascade=orphan</code>. Before deleting it, you make a note of what selector it uses:</p> <div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4" data-language="shell">kubectl get job old -o yaml

  ...
</pre></div>
<p>Then you create a new Job with name <code>new</code> and you explicitly specify the same selector. Since the existing Pods have label <code>controller-uid=a8f3d00d-c6d2-11e5-9f87-42010af00002</code>, they are controlled by Job <code>new</code> as well.</p> <p>You need to specify <code>manualSelector: true</code> in the new Job since you are not using the selector that the system normally generates for you automatically.</p> <div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4" data-language="yaml">kind: Job

<p>The new Job itself will have a different uid from <code>a8f3d00d-c6d2-11e5-9f87-42010af00002</code>.

To do that, the Job controller creates Pods with the finalizer <code>batch.kubernetes.io/job-tracking</code>. The controller removes the finalizer only after the Pod has been accounted for in the Job status, allowing the Pod to be removed by other controllers or users.</p> <p>The Job controller uses the new algorithm for new Jobs only. Jobs created before the feature is enabled are unaffected.
