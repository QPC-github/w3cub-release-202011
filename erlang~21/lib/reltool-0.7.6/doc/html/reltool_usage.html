<h1>2 Usage</h1> <h2><span onmouseover="document.getElementById('ghlink-overview-id63698').style.visibility = 'visible';" onmouseout="document.getElementById('ghlink-overview-id63698').style.visibility = 'hidden';" id="overview">2.1 Overview</span></h2> <p>This document focuses on the graphical parts of the tool. The concepts are explained in the reference manual for the module <code class="code">reltool</code>.</p> <h2><span onmouseover="document.getElementById('ghlink-system-window-id63308').style.visibility = 'visible';" onmouseout="document.getElementById('ghlink-system-window-id63308').style.visibility = 'hidden';" id="system-window">2.2 System window</span></h2> <p>The system window is started with the function <code class="code">reltool:start/1</code>. At startup the tool will process all <code class="code">beam</code> files and <code class="code">app</code> files in order to find out dependencies between applications and their modules. Once all this information has been derived, it will be possible to explore the tool.</p> <p>The system window consists of four main pages (tabs):</p> <ul> <li>Libraries </li> <li>System settings </li> <li>Applications </li> <li>Releases </li> </ul> <p>Click on a name tag to display its page.</p> <h4><span onmouseover="document.getElementById('ghlink-libraries-id63466').style.visibility = 'visible';" onmouseout="document.getElementById('ghlink-libraries-id63466').style.visibility = 'hidden';" id="libraries">Libraries</span></h4> <p>On the library page it is possible to control which sources the tool will use. The page is organized as a tree which can be expanded and collapsed by clicking on the little symbol in the beginning of the expandable/collapsible lines.</p> <p>The <code class="code">Root directory</code> can be edited by selecting the line where the path of the root directory is displayed and clicking the right mouse button. Choose edit in the menu that pops up.</p> <p>Library directories can be added, edited or deleted. This is done by selecting the line where the path to a library directory is displayed and clicking the right mouse button. Choose add, edit or delete in the menu that pops up. New library directories can also be added by selecting the line <code class="code">Library directories</code> and clicking the right mouse button. Choose add in the menu that pops up.</p> <p>Escript files can be added, edited or deleted. This is done by selecting the line where the path to an escript file is displayed and clicking the right mouse button. Choose add, edit or delete in the menu that pops up. New escripts can also be added by selecting the line <code class="code">Escript files</code> and clicking the right mouse button. Choose add in the menu that pops up.</p> <p>When libraries and escripts are expanded, the names of their contained applications will be displayed. Double click on an application name to launch an application window.</p> <h4><span onmouseover="document.getElementById('ghlink-system-settings-id63708').style.visibility = 'visible';" onmouseout="document.getElementById('ghlink-system-settings-id63708').style.visibility = 'hidden';" id="system-settings">System settings</span></h4> <p>On the system settings page it is possible to control some global settings that are used as defaults for all applications. Set the <code class="code">Application inclusion policy</code> to <code class="code">include</code> to include all applications that are not explicitly excluded. See <code class="code">incl_cond</code> (application inclusion) and <code class="code">mod_cond</code> (module inclusion) in the reference manual for the module <code class="code">reltool</code> for more info.</p> <p>The system settings page is rather incomplete.</p> <h4><span onmouseover="document.getElementById('ghlink-applications-id59220').style.visibility = 'visible';" onmouseout="document.getElementById('ghlink-applications-id59220').style.visibility = 'hidden';" id="applications">Applications</span></h4> <p>There are four categories of applications on the applications page. <code class="code">Included</code> contains applications that are explicitly included. <code class="code">Excluded</code> contains applications that are explicitly excluded. <code class="code">Derived</code> contains applications that either are used directly by explicitly included applications or by other derived applications. <code class="code">Available</code> contains the remaining applications.</p> <p>Select one or more applications and click on a button directly below the application column to change application category. For example, select an available application and click on its tick button to move the application to the included category. Clicking on the tick symbol for included applications will move the application back to the available category. The tick is undone.</p> <p>The symbols in front of the application names are intended to describe the status of the application. There are error and warning symbols to signalize that there is something which needs attention. The tick symbol means that the application is included or derived and no problem has been detected. The cross symbol means that the application is excluded or available and no problem has been detected. Applications with error symbols are listed first in each category and are followed by the warnings and the normal ones (ticks and crosses) at the end.</p> <p>Double click on an application to launch its application window.</p> <h4><span onmouseover="document.getElementById('ghlink-releases-id61266').style.visibility = 'visible';" onmouseout="document.getElementById('ghlink-releases-id61266').style.visibility = 'hidden';" id="releases">Releases</span></h4> <p>The releases page is incomplete and very experimental.</p> <h4><span onmouseover="document.getElementById('ghlink-file-menu-id61445').style.visibility = 'visible';" onmouseout="document.getElementById('ghlink-file-menu-id61445').style.visibility = 'hidden';" id="file-menu">File menu</span></h4> <ul> <li> <p><code class="code">Display application dependency graph</code> - Launches an application force graph window. All included and derived applications and their dependencies will be shown in a graph.</p> </li> <li> <p><code class="code">Display module dependency graph</code> - Launch a module force graph window. All included and derived modules and their dependencies will be shown in a graph.</p> </li> <li> <p><code class="code">Reset configuration to default</code></p> </li> <li> <p><code class="code">Undo configuration (toggle)</code></p> </li> <li> <p><code class="code">Load configuration</code> - Loads a new configuration from file.</p> </li> <li> <p><code class="code">Save configuration</code> - Saves the current configuration to file. Normally, only the explicit configuration parameters with values that differ from their defaults are saved. But the configuration with or without default values and with or without derived values may also be saved.</p> </li> <li> <p><code class="code">Generate rel, script and boot files</code></p> </li> <li> <p><code class="code">Generate target system</code></p> </li> <li> <p><code class="code">Close</code> - Close the system window and all its subwindows.</p> </li> </ul> <h4><span onmouseover="document.getElementById('ghlink-dependencies-between-applications-or-modules-displayed-as-a-graph-id63748').style.visibility = 'visible';" onmouseout="document.getElementById('ghlink-dependencies-between-applications-or-modules-displayed-as-a-graph-id63748').style.visibility = 'hidden';" id="dependencies-between-applications-or-modules-displayed-as-a-graph">Dependencies between applications or modules displayed as a graph</span></h4> <p>The dependency graph windows are launched from the file menu in the system window. The graph depicts all included and derived applications/modules and their dependencies.</p> <p>It is possible to perform some limited manipulations of the graph. Nodes can be moved, selected, locked or deleted. Move a single node or the entire graph by moving the mouse while the left mouse button is pressed. A node can be locked into a fix position by holding down the shift button when the left mouse button is released. Select several nodes by moving the mouse while the control key and the left mouse button are pressed. Selected nodes can be locked, unlocked or deleted by clicking on a suitable button.</p> <p>The algorithm that is used to draw a graph with as few crossed links as possible is called force graph. A force graph consists of nodes and directed links between nodes. Each node is associated with a repulsive force that pushes nodes away from each other. This force can be adjusted with the left slider or with the mouse wheel. Each link is associated with an attractive force that pulls the nodes nearer to each other. This force can be adjusted with the right slider. If this force becomes too strong, the graph will be unstable. The third parameter that can be adjusted is the length of the links. It is adjusted with the middle slider.</p> <p>The <code class="code">Freeze</code> button starts/stops the redrawing of the graph. <code class="code">Reset</code> moves the graph to the middle of the window and resets all graph settings to default, with the exception of deleted nodes.</p> <h2><span onmouseover="document.getElementById('ghlink-application-window-id61497').style.visibility = 'visible';" onmouseout="document.getElementById('ghlink-application-window-id61497').style.visibility = 'hidden';" id="application-window">2.3 Application window</span></h2> <p>The application window is started by double clicking on an application name.

By default the latest version of the application is selected, but it is possible to override this by explicitly selecting another version.</p> <p>Note that in order for reltool to sort application versions and thereby be able to select the latest, it is required that the version id for the application consits of integers and dots only, for example <code class="code">1</code>, <code class="code">2.0</code> or <code class="code">3.17.1</code>.</p> <p>By default the <code class="code">Application inclusion policy</code> on system level is used for all applications. Set the value to <code class="code">include</code> if you want to explicitly include one particular application. Set it to <code class="code">exclude</code> if you want to exclude the application despite that it is used by another (explicitly or implicitly) included application. <code class="code">derived</code> means that the application automatically will be included if some other (explicitly or implicitly) included application uses it.</p> <p>By default the <code class="code">Module inclusion policy</code> on system level is used for all applications. Set it to <code class="code">derived</code> if you only want actually used modules to be included. Set it to <code class="code">app</code> if you, besides derived modules, also want the modules listed in the app file to be included. Set it to <code class="code">ebin</code> if you, besides derived modules, also want the modules that exist as beam files in the ebin directory to be included. Set it to <code class="code">all</code> if you want all modules to be included, that is the union of modules found in the ebin directory and listed in the app file.</p> <p>The application settings page is rather incomplete.</p> <h4><span onmouseover="document.getElementById('ghlink-modules-id62958').style.visibility = 'visible';" onmouseout="document.getElementById('ghlink-modules-id62958').style.visibility = 'hidden';" id="modules">Modules</span></h4> <p>There are four categories of modules on the modules page. <code class="code">Included</code> contains modules that are explicitly included. <code class="code">Excluded</code> contains modules that are explicitly excluded. <code class="code">Derived</code> contains modules that either are used directly by explicitly included modules or by other derived modules. <code class="code">Available</code> contains the remaining modules.</p> <p>Select one or more modules and click on a button directly below the module column to change module category.

If the application is used by other applications, these are listed under <code class="code">Used by</code>. If the application requires other applications be started before it can be started, these are listed under <code class="code">Required</code>. These applications are listed in the <code class="code">applications</code> part of the <code class="code">app</code> file. If the application includes other applications, these are listed under <code class="code">Included</code>.
