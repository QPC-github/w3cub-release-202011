<td><strong>Get configuration data</strong></td> <td>The chef-client gets process configuration data from the client.rb file on the node, and then gets node configuration data from Ohai. One important piece of configuration data is the name of the node, which is found in the <code class="docutils literal">node_name</code> attribute in the client.rb file or is provided by Ohai. If Ohai provides the name of a node, it is typically the FQDN for the node, which is always unique within an organization.</td> </tr> <tr class="row-odd">
<td><strong>Authenticate to the Chef Server</strong></td> <td>The chef-client authenticates to the Chef server using an RSA private key and the Chef server API. The name of the node is required as part of the authentication process to the Chef server. If this is the first chef-client run for a node, the chef-validator will be used to generate the RSA private key.</td> </tr> <tr class="row-even">
<td><strong>Get, rebuild the node object</strong></td> <td>The chef-client pulls down the node object from the Chef server. If this is the first chef-client run for the node, there will not be a node object to pull down from the Chef server. After the node object is pulled down from the Chef server, the chef-client rebuilds the node object. If this is the first chef-client run for the node, the rebuilt node object will contain only the default run-list. For any subsequent chef-client run, the rebuilt node object will also contain the run-list from the previous chef-client run.</td> </tr> <tr class="row-odd">
<td><strong>Expand the run-list</strong></td> <td>The chef-client expands the run-list from the rebuilt node object, compiling a full and complete list of roles and recipes that will be applied to the node, placing the roles and recipes in the same exact order they will be applied. (The run-list is stored in each node object’s JSON file, grouped under <code class="docutils literal">run_list</code>.)</td> </tr> <tr class="row-even">
<td><strong>Synchronize cookbooks</strong></td> <td>The chef-client asks the Chef server for a list of all cookbook files (including recipes, templates, resources, providers, attributes, libraries, and definitions) that will be required to do every action identified in the run-list for the rebuilt node object. The Chef server provides to the chef-client a list of all of those files. The chef-client compares this list to the cookbook files cached on the node (from previous chef-client runs), and then downloads a copy of every file that has changed since the previous chef-client run, along with any new files.</td> </tr> <tr class="row-odd">
<td><strong>Reset node attributes</strong></td> <td>All attributes in the rebuilt node object are reset. All attributes from attribute files, environments, roles, and Ohai are loaded. Attributes that are defined in attribute files are first loaded according to cookbook order. For each cookbook, attributes in the <code class="docutils literal">default.rb</code> file are loaded first, and then additional attribute files (if present) are loaded in lexical sort order. All attributes in the rebuilt node object are updated with the attribute data according to attribute precedence. When all of the attributes are updated, the rebuilt node object is complete.</td> </tr> <tr class="row-even">
<td><strong>Compile the resource collection</strong></td> <td>The chef-client identifies each resource in the node object and builds the resource collection. Libraries are loaded first to ensure that all language extensions and Ruby classes are available to all resources. Next, attributes are loaded, followed by lightweight resources, and then all definitions (to ensure that any pseudo-resources within definitions are available). Finally, all recipes are loaded in the order specified by the expanded run-list. This is also referred to as the “compile phase”.</td> </tr> <tr class="row-odd">
<td><strong>Converge the node</strong></td> <td>The chef-client configures the system based on the information that has been collected. Each resource is executed in the order identified by the run-list, and then by the order in which each resource is listed in each recipe. Each resource in the resource collection is mapped to a provider. The provider examines the node, and then does the steps necessary to complete the action. And then the next resource is processed. Each action configures a specific part of the system. This process is also referred to as convergence. This is also referred to as the “execution phase”.</td> </tr> <tr class="row-even">
<td><strong>Update the node object, process exception and report handlers</strong></td> <td>
<p class="first">When all of the actions identified by resources in the resource collection have been done, and when the chef-client run finished successfully, the chef-client updates the node object on the Chef server with the node object that was built during this chef-client run. (This node object will be pulled down by the chef-client during the next chef-client run.) This makes the node object (and the data in the node object) available for search.</p> <p class="last">The chef-client always checks the resource collection for the presence of exception and report handlers. If any are present, each one is processed appropriately.</p> </td> </tr> <tr class="row-odd">
<td><strong>Stop, wait for the next run</strong></td> <td>When everything is configured and the chef-client run is complete, the chef-client stops and waits until the next time it is asked to run.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>  <h3 id="authentication">Authentication</h3> <p>All communication with the Chef server must be authenticated using the Chef server API, which is a REST API that allows requests to be made to the Chef server. Only authenticated requests will be authorized. Most of the time, and especially when using knife, the chef-client, or the Chef server web interface, the use of the Chef server API is transparent. In some cases, the use of the Chef server API requires more detail, such as when making the request in Ruby code, with a knife plugin, or when using cURL.</p> <p>The authentication process ensures the Chef server responds only to requests made by trusted users. Public key encryption is used by the Chef server. When a node and/or a workstation is configured to run the chef-client, both public and private keys are created. The public key is stored on the Chef server, while the private key is returned to the user for safe keeping. (The private key is a .pem file located in the <code class="docutils literal">.chef</code> directory or in <code class="docutils literal">/etc/chef</code>.)</p> <p>Both the chef-client and knife use the Chef server API when communicating with the Chef server. The chef-validator uses the Chef server API, but only during the first chef-client run on a node.</p> <p>Each request to the Chef server from those executables sign a special group of HTTP headers with the private key. The Chef server then uses the public key to verify the headers and verify the contents.</p>   <h3 id="chef-validator">chef-validator</h3> <p>Every request made by the chef-client to the Chef server must be an authenticated request using the Chef server API and a private key. When the chef-client makes a request to the Chef server, the chef-client authenticates each request using a private key located in <code class="docutils literal">/etc/chef/client.pem</code>.</p> <p>However, during the first chef-client run, this private key does not exist. Instead, the chef-client will attempt to use the private key assigned to the chef-validator, located in <code class="docutils literal">/etc/chef/validation.pem</code>. (If, for any reason, the chef-validator is unable to make an authenticated request to the Chef server, the initial chef-client run will fail.)</p> <p>During the initial chef-client run, the chef-client will register with the Chef server using the private key assigned to the chef-validator, after which the chef-client will obtain a <code class="docutils literal">client.pem</code> private key for all future authentication requests to the Chef server.</p> <p>After the initial chef-client run has completed successfully, the chef-validator is no longer required and may be deleted from the node. Use the <code class="docutils literal">delete_validation</code> recipe found in the <code class="docutils literal">chef-client</code> cookbook (<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/chef-client">https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/chef-client</a>) to remove the chef-validator.</p>    <h2 id="ssl-certificates">SSL Certificates</h2> <p>An SSL certificate is used between the chef-client and the Chef server to ensure that each node has access to the right data.</p>  <h3 id="signed-headers">Signed Headers</h3> <p>Signed header authentication is used to validate communications between the Chef server and any node that is being managed by the Chef server. An API client manages each authentication request. A public and private key pair is used for the authentication itself. The public key is stored in the database on the Chef server. The private key is stored locally on each node and is kept separate from node data (typically in the <code class="docutils literal">/etc/chef/client.pem</code> directory). Each request to the Chef server by a node must include a request signature in the HTTP headers. This signature is computed from a hash of request content and is encrypted using the private key.</p>   <h3 id="during-a-chef-client-run">During a chef-client Run</h3> <p>As part of <a class="reference internal" href="#chef-client-the-chef-client-run">every chef-client run</a>, the chef-client authenticates to the Chef server using an RSA private key and the Chef server API.</p>    <h2 id="ssl-verification">SSL Verification</h2> <div class="admonition warning"> <p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p> <p class="last">The following information does not apply to hosted Chef server 12, only to on-premises Chef server 12.</p> </div> <p>Chef server 12 enables SSL verification by default for all requests made to the server, such as those made by knife and the chef-client. The certificate that is generated during the installation of the Chef server is self-signed, which means the certificate is not signed by a trusted certificate authority (CA) that ships with the chef-client. The certificate generated by the Chef server must be downloaded to any machine from which knife and/or the chef-client will make requests to the Chef server.</p> <p>For example, without downloading the SSL certificate, the following knife command:</p> <pre class="highlight-bash" data-language="bash">$ knife client list</pre> <p>responds with an error similar to:</p> <pre class="highlight-bash" data-language="bash">ERROR: SSL Validation failure connecting to host: chef-server.example.com ...

  /C=US/ST=WA/L=S/O=Corp/OU=Ops/CN=chef-server.example.com/emailAddress=you@example.com

Configuration Info:

OpenSSL Configuration:
* Version: OpenSSL 1.0.1j 15 Oct 2014
* Certificate file: /opt/chefdk/embedded/ssl/cert.pem
* Certificate directory: /opt/chefdk/embedded/ssl/certs
Chef SSL Configuration:

* trusted_certs_dir: "/Users/grantmc/Downloads/chef-repo/.chef/trusted_certs"

TO FIX THIS ERROR:

If the server you are connecting to uses a self-signed certificate,
you must configure chef to trust that certificate.

By default, the certificate is stored in the following location on the
host where your chef-server runs:

  /var/opt/opscode/nginx/ca/SERVER_HOSTNAME.crt

Copy that file to your trusted_certs_dir (currently:

  /Users/grantmc/Downloads/chef-repo/.chef/trusted_certs)

using SSH/SCP or some other secure method, then re-run this command to
confirm that the certificate is now trusted.</pre>   <h4 id="knife-ssl-fetch">knife ssl fetch</h4> <p>Run the <code class="docutils literal">knife ssl fetch</code> to download the self-signed certificate from the Chef server to the <code class="docutils literal">/.chef/trusted_certs</code> directory on a workstation.

The default for this approach assumes that a node can access the Chef website so that it may download the chef-client package from that location.</p> <p>The omnibus installer will detect the version of the operating system, and then install the appropriate version of the chef-client using a single command to install the chef-client and all of its dependencies, including an embedded version of Ruby, RubyGems, OpenSSL, key-value stores, parsers, libraries, and command line utilities.</p> <p>The omnibus installer puts everything into a unique directory (<code class="docutils literal">/opt/chef/</code>) so that the chef-client will not interfere with other applications that may be running on the target machine. Once installed, the chef-client requires a few more configuration steps before it can perform its first chef-client run on a node.</p> <p>A node is any physical, virtual, or cloud machine that is configured to be maintained by a chef-client. A bootstrap is a process that installs the chef-client on a target system so that it can run as a chef-client and communicate with a Chef server. There are two ways to do this:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>Use the <code class="docutils literal">knife bootstrap</code> subcommand to <a class="reference internal" href="install_bootstrap">bootstrap a node using the omnibus installer</a>
</li> <li>Use an unattended install to bootstrap a node from itself, without using SSH or WinRM</li> </ul> <p>The following diagram shows the stages of the bootstrap operation, and then the list below the diagram describes in greater detail each of those stages.</p> <img alt="_images/chef_bootstrap.png" src="https://docs-archive.chef.io/release/12-13/_images/chef_bootstrap.png"> <p>During a <code class="docutils literal">knife bootstrap</code> bootstrap operation, the following happens:</p> <table class="docutils"> <colgroup> <col width="25%"> <col width="75%"> </colgroup> <thead valign="bottom"> <tr class="row-odd">
