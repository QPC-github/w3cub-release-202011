<h1 id="about-resources">About Resources</h1> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="first admonition-title">Note</p> <p class="last">If you want to see all of the information about resources in a single document, see: <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.chef.io/resources.html">https://docs.chef.io/resources.html</a>. Keep reading this page for topics about individual resources.</p> </div> <p>A resource is a statement of configuration policy that:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>Describes the desired state for a configuration item</li> <li>Declares the steps needed to bring that item to the desired state</li> <li>Specifies a resource type—such as <code class="docutils literal">package</code>, <code class="docutils literal">template</code>, or <code class="docutils literal">service</code>
</li> <li>Lists additional details (also known as resource properties), as necessary</li> <li>Are grouped into recipes, which describe working configurations</li> </ul> <p>Where a resource represents a piece of the system (and its desired state), a provider defines the steps that are needed to bring that piece of the system from its current state into the desired state.</p> <p>The <code class="docutils literal">Chef::Platform</code> class maps providers to platforms (and platform versions). At the beginning of every chef-client run, Ohai verifies the <code class="docutils literal">platform</code> and <code class="docutils literal">platform_version</code> attributes on each node. The chef-client then uses those values to identify the correct provider, build an instance of that provider, identify the current state of the resource, do the specified action, and then mark the resource as updated (if changes were made).</p> <p>For example:</p> <pre class="highlight-ruby" data-language="ruby">directory '/tmp/folder' do
  owner 'root'
  group 'root'
  mode '0755'
  action :create
end</pre> <p>The chef-client will look up the provider for the <code class="docutils literal">directory</code> resource, which happens to be <code class="docutils literal">Chef::Provider::Directory</code>, call <code class="docutils literal">load_current_resource</code> to create a <code class="docutils literal">directory["/tmp/folder"]</code> resource, and then, based on the current state of the directory, do the specified action, which in this case is to create a directory called <code class="docutils literal">/tmp/folder</code>. If the directory already exists, nothing will happen. If the directory was changed in any way, the resource is marked as updated.</p>  <h2 id="resources-syntax">Resources Syntax</h2> <p>A resource is a Ruby block with four components: a type, a name, one (or more) properties (with values), and one (or more) actions. The syntax for a resource is like this:</p> <pre class="highlight-ruby" data-language="ruby">type 'name' do
   attribute 'value'
   action :type_of_action
end</pre> <p>Every resource has its own set of actions and properties. Most properties have default values. Some properties are available to all resources, for example those used to send notifications to other resources and guards that help ensure that some resources are idempotent.</p> <p>For example, a resource that is used to install a tar.gz package for version 1.16.1 may look something like this:</p> <pre class="highlight-ruby" data-language="ruby">package 'tar' do
  version '1.16.1'
  action :install
end</pre> <p>All actions have a default value. Only non-default behaviors of actions and properties need to be specified. For example, the <strong>package</strong> resource’s default action is <code class="docutils literal">:install</code> and the name of the package defaults to the <code class="docutils literal">name</code> of the resource. Therefore, it is possible to write a resource block that installs the latest tar.gz package like this:</p> <pre class="highlight-ruby" data-language="ruby">package 'tar'</pre> <p>and a resource block that installs a tar.gz package for version 1.6.1 like this:</p> <pre class="highlight-ruby" data-language="ruby">package 'tar' do
  version '1.16.1'
end</pre> <p>In both cases, the chef-client will use the default action (<code class="docutils literal">:install</code>) to install the <code class="docutils literal">tar</code> package.</p>   <h2 id="common-functionality">Common Functionality</h2> <p>All resources (including custom resources) share a set of common actions, properties, conditional executions, notifications, and relative path options.</p> <table class="docutils"> <colgroup> <col width="27%"> <col width="73%"> </colgroup> <thead valign="bottom"> <tr class="row-odd">
