<h1 id="intro">Introduction</h1> <p id="introduction">This is the documentation for <em>fish</em>, the <strong>f</strong>riendly <strong>i</strong>nteractive <strong>sh</strong>ell.</p> <p>A shell is a program which helps you operate your computer by starting other programs. fish offers a command-line interface focused on usability and interactive use.</p> <p>Unlike other shells, fish does not follow the POSIX standard, but still roughly belongs to the same family.</p> <p>Some of the special features of fish are:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>
<strong>Extensive UI</strong>: <a class="reference internal" href="#syntax-highlighting">syntax highlighting</a>, <a class="reference internal" href="#autosuggestions">autosuggestions</a>, <a class="reference internal" href="#tab-completion">tab completion</a> and selection lists that can be navigated and filtered.</li> <li>
<strong>No configuration needed</strong>: fish is designed to be ready to use immediately, without requiring extensive configuration.</li> <li>
<strong>Easy scripting</strong>: new <a class="reference internal" href="#functions">functions</a> can be added on the fly. The syntax is easy to learn and use.</li> </ul> <p>This bit of the documentation is a quick guide on how to get going. If you are new to this, see the <a class="reference internal" href="tutorial#tutorial"><span class="std std-ref">tutorial</span></a>.</p>   <h1 id="installation-and-start">Installation and Start</h1> <p>This section is on how to install, uninstall, start and exit a fish shell and on how to make fish the default shell:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>
<a class="reference internal" href="#installation">Installation</a>: How to install fish</li> <li>
<a class="reference internal" href="#starting-and-exiting">Starting and Exiting</a> How to start and exit a fish shell</li> <li>
<a class="reference internal" href="#executing-bash">Executing Bash</a>: How to execute bash commands in fish</li> <li>
<a class="reference internal" href="#default-shell">Default Shell</a>: How to switch to fish as the default shell</li> <li>
<a class="reference internal" href="#uninstalling">Uninstalling</a>: How to uninstall fish</li> </ul>  <h2 id="installation">Installation</h2> <p>Up-to-date instructions for installing the latest version of fish are on the <a class="reference external" href="https://fishshell.com/">fish homepage</a>.</p> <p>To install the development version of fish see the instructions at the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell">project's GitHub page</a>.</p>   <h2 id="starting-and-exiting">Starting and Exiting</h2> <p>Once fish has been installed, open a terminal. If fish is not the default shell:</p> <ul> <li>
<p class="first">Enter <code>fish</code> to start a fish shell:</p> <pre data-language="fish">&gt; fish
</pre> </li> <li>
<p class="first">Enter <code>exit</code> to exit a fish shell:</p> <pre data-language="fish">&gt; exit
</pre> </li> </ul>   <h2 id="executing-bash">Executing Bash</h2> <p>If fish is your default shell and you want to copy commands from the internet that are written in a different shell language, bash for example, you can proceed in the following way:</p> <p>Consider, that <code>bash</code> is also a command. With <code>man bash</code> you can see that there are two ways to do this:</p> <ul> <li>
<p class="first"><code>bash</code> has a switch <code>-c</code> to read from a string:</p> <pre data-language="fish">&gt; bash -c SomeBashCommand
</pre> </li> </ul> <p>or <code>bash</code> without a switch, opens a bash shell that you can use and <code>exit</code> afterwards.</p>   <h2 id="default-shell">Default Shell</h2> <p>You can make fish your default shell by adding fish's executable in two places: - add <code>/usr/local/bin/fish</code> to <code>/etc/shells</code> - change your default shell with <code>chsh -s</code> to <code>/usr/local/bin/fish</code></p> <p>For for detailed instructions see <a class="reference internal" href="tutorial#switching-to-fish"><span class="std std-ref">Switching to fish</span></a>.</p>   <h2 id="uninstalling">Uninstalling</h2> <p>For uninstalling fish: see <a class="reference internal" href="faq#faq-uninstalling"><span class="std std-ref">FAQ: Uninstalling fish</span></a>.</p>   <h2 id="shebang-line">Shebang Line</h2> <p>Since scripts for shell commands can be written in many different languages, they need to carry information about what interpreter is needed to execute them: For this they are expected to have a first line, the shebang line, which names an executable for this purpose:</p> <p>Example:</p> <p>A scripts written in <code>bash</code> it would need a first line like this:</p> <pre data-language="fish">#!/bin/bash
</pre> <p>This line tells the shell to execute the file with the bash interpreter, that is located at the path <code>/bin/bash</code>.</p> <p>For a script, written in another language, just replace the interpreter <code>/bin/bash</code> with the language interpreter of that other language (for example <code>/bin/python</code> for a <code>python</code> script)</p> <p>This line is only needed when scripts are executed without specifying the interpreter. For functions inside fish or when executing a script with <code>`fish /path/to/script</code> they aren't required (but don't hurt either!).</p>    <h1 id="syntax">Syntax overview</h1> <p id="syntax-overview">Shells like fish are used by giving them commands. Every <code>fish</code> command follows the same basic syntax.</p> <p>A command is executed by writing the name of the command followed by any arguments.</p> <p>Example:</p> <pre data-language="fish">echo hello world
</pre> <p>This calls the <code>echo</code> command. <code>echo</code> is a command which will write its arguments to the screen. In the example above, the output will be 'hello world'. Everything in fish is done with commands. There are commands for performing a set of commands multiple times, commands for assigning variables, commands for treating a group of commands as a single command, etc.. And every single command follows the same basic syntax.</p> <p>If you want to find out more about the echo command used above, read the manual page for the echo command by writing: <code>man echo</code></p> <p><code>man</code> is a command for displaying a manual page on a given topic. The man command takes the name of the manual page to display as an argument. There are manual pages for almost every command on most computers. There are also manual pages for many other things, such as system libraries and important files.</p> <p>Every program on your computer can be used as a command in <code>fish</code>. If the program file is located in one of the directories in the <a class="reference internal" href="#path">PATH</a>, you can just use the name of the program to use it. Otherwise the whole filename, including the directory (like <code>/home/me/code/checkers/checkers</code> or <code>../checkers</code>) has to be used.</p> <p>Here is a list of some useful commands:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>
<code>cd</code>, change the current directory</li> <li>
<code>ls</code>, list files and directories</li> <li>
<code>man</code>, display a manual page on the screen</li> <li>
<code>mv</code>, move (rename) files</li> <li>
<code>cp</code>, copy files</li> <li>
<code>open</code>, open files with the default application associated with each filetype</li> <li>
<code>less</code>, list the contents of files</li> </ul> <p>Commands and parameters are separated by the space character <code>' '</code>. Every command ends with either a newline (i.e. by pressing the return key) or a semicolon '<code>;</code>'. More than one command can be written on the same line by separating them with semicolons.</p> <p>A switch is a very common special type of argument. Switches almost always start with one or more hyphens '<code>-</code>' and alter the way a command operates. For example, the '<code>ls</code>' command usually lists all the files and directories in the current working directory, but by using the '<code>-l</code>' switch, the behavior of '<code>ls</code>' is changed to not only display the filename, but also the size, permissions, owner and modification time of each file.</p> <p>Switches differ between commands and are documented in the manual page for each command. Some switches are common to most command though, for example '<code>--help</code>' will usually display a help text, '<code>-i</code>' will often turn on interactive prompting before taking action, while '<code>-f</code>' will turn it off.</p>  <h2 id="syntax-words">Some common words</h2> <p id="some-common-words">This is a short explanation of some of the commonly used words in fish.</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>
<strong>argument</strong> a parameter given to a command</li> <li>
<strong>builtin</strong> a command that is implemented in the shell. Builtins are commands that are so closely tied to the shell that it is impossible to implement them as external commands.</li> <li>
<strong>command</strong> a program that the shell can run. In another sense also specifically an external command (i.e. neither a function or builtin).</li> <li>
<strong>function</strong> a block of commands that can be called as if they were a single command. By using functions, it is possible to string together multiple smaller commands into one more advanced command.</li> <li>
<strong>job</strong> a running pipeline or command</li> <li>
<strong>pipeline</strong> a set of commands stringed together so that the output of one command is the input of the next command</li> <li>
<strong>redirection</strong> an operation that changes one of the input/output streams associated with a job</li> <li>
<strong>switch</strong> a special flag sent as an argument to a command that will alter the behavior of the command. A switch almost always begins with one or two hyphens.</li> </ul>   <h2 id="quotes">Quotes</h2> <p>Sometimes features such as <a class="reference external" href="#expand">parameter expansion</a> and <a class="reference external" href="#escapes">character escapes</a> get in the way. When that happens, the user can write a parameter within quotes, either <code>'</code> (single quote) or <code>"</code> (double quote). There is one important difference between single quoted and double quoted strings: When using double quoted string, <a class="reference external" href="#expand-variable">variable expansion</a> still takes place. Other than that, no other kind of expansion (including <a class="reference external" href="#expand-brace">brace expansion</a> and parameter expansion) will take place, the parameter may contain spaces, and escape sequences are ignored.</p> <p>The only backslash escape accepted within single quotes is <code>\'</code>, which escapes a single quote and <code>\\</code>, which escapes the backslash symbol. The only backslash escapes accepted within double quotes are <code>\"</code>, which escapes a double quote, <code>\$</code>, which escapes a dollar character, <code>\</code> followed by a newline, which deletes the backslash and the newline, and lastly <code>\\</code>, which escapes the backslash symbol. Single quotes have no special meaning within double quotes and vice versa.</p> <p>Example:</p> <pre data-language="fish">rm "cumbersome filename.txt"
</pre> <p>Will remove the file 'cumbersome filename.txt', while</p> <pre data-language="fish">rm cumbersome filename.txt
</pre> <p>would remove the two files 'cumbersome' and 'filename.txt'.</p>   <h2 id="escapes">Escaping characters</h2> <p id="escaping-characters">Some characters can not be written directly on the command line. For these characters, so called escape sequences are provided. These are:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>
<code>\a</code> represents the alert character</li> <li>
<code>\b</code> represents the backspace character</li> <li>
<code>\e</code> represents the escape character</li> <li>
<code>\f</code> represents the form feed character</li> <li>
<code>\n</code> represents a newline character</li> <li>
<code>\r</code> represents the carriage return character</li> <li>
<code>\t</code> represents the tab character</li> <li>
<code>\v</code> represents the vertical tab character</li> <li>
<code>\ </code> escapes the space character</li> <li>
<code>\$</code> escapes the dollar character</li> <li>
<code>\\</code> escapes the backslash character</li> <li>
<code>\*</code> escapes the star character</li> <li>
<code>\?</code> escapes the question mark character (this is not necessary if the <code>qmark-noglob</code> <a class="reference internal" href="#featureflags"><span class="std std-ref">feature flag</span></a> is enabled)</li> <li>
<code>\~</code> escapes the tilde character</li> <li>
<code>\#</code> escapes the hash character</li> <li>
<code>\(</code> escapes the left parenthesis character</li> <li>
<code>\)</code> escapes the right parenthesis character</li> <li>
<code>\{</code> escapes the left curly bracket character</li> <li>
<code>\}</code> escapes the right curly bracket character</li> <li>
<code>\[</code> escapes the left bracket character</li> <li>
<code>\]</code> escapes the right bracket character</li> <li>
<code>\\&lt;</code> escapes the less than character</li> <li>
<code>\\&gt;</code> escapes the more than character</li> <li>
<code>\^</code> escapes the circumflex character</li> <li>
<code>\&amp;</code> escapes the ampersand character</li> <li>
<code>\|</code> escapes the vertical bar character</li> <li>
<code>\;</code> escapes the semicolon character</li> <li>
<code>\"</code> escapes the quote character</li> <li>
<code>\'</code> escapes the apostrophe character</li> <li>
<code>\xHH</code>, where <em>HH</em> is a hexadecimal number, represents the ascii character with the specified value. For example, <code>\x9</code> is the tab character.</li> <li>
<code>\XHH</code>, where <em>HH</em> is a hexadecimal number, represents a byte of data with the specified value. If you are using a multibyte encoding, this can be used to enter invalid strings. Only use this if you know what you are doing.</li> <li>
<code>\ooo</code>, where <em>ooo</em> is an octal number, represents the ascii character with the specified value. For example, <code>\011</code> is the tab character.</li> <li>
<code>\uXXXX</code>, where <em>XXXX</em> is a hexadecimal number, represents the 16-bit Unicode character with the specified value. For example, <code>\u9</code> is the tab character.</li> <li>
<code>\UXXXXXXXX</code>, where <em>XXXXXXXX</em> is a hexadecimal number, represents the 32-bit Unicode character with the specified value. For example, <code>\U9</code> is the tab character.</li> <li>
<code>\cX</code>, where <em>X</em> is a letter of the alphabet, represents the control sequence generated by pressing the control key and the specified letter. For example, <code>\ci</code> is the tab character</li> </ul>   <h2 id="redirects">Input/Output Redirection</h2> <p id="input-output-redirection">Most programs use three input/output <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id3" id="id1">[1]</a> streams, each represented by a number called a file descriptor (FD). These are:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>Standard input, FD 0, for reading, defaults to reading from the keyboard.</li> <li>Standard output, FD 1, for writing, defaults to writing to the screen.</li> <li>Standard error, FD 2, for writing errors and warnings, defaults to writing to the screen.</li> </ul> <p>Any file descriptor can be directed to a different output than its default through a mechanism called a redirection.</p> <p>An example of a file redirection is <code>echo hello &gt; output.txt</code>, which directs the output of the echo command to the file output.txt.</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>To read standard input from a file, write <code>&lt;SOURCE_FILE</code>
</li> <li>To write standard output to a file, write <code>&gt;DESTINATION</code>
</li> <li>To write standard error to a file, write <code>2&gt;DESTINATION</code> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id4" id="id2">[2]</a>
</li> <li>To append standard output to a file, write <code>&gt;&gt;DESTINATION_FILE</code>
</li> <li>To append standard error to a file, write <code>2&gt;&gt;DESTINATION_FILE</code>
</li> <li>To not overwrite ("clobber") an existing file, write <code>&gt;?DESTINATION</code> or <code>2&gt;?DESTINATION</code> (this is also known as the "noclobber" redirection)</li> </ul> <p><code>DESTINATION</code> can be one of the following:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>A filename. The output will be written to the specified file.</li> <li>An ampersand (<code>&amp;</code>) followed by the number of another file descriptor. The output will be written to that file descriptor instead.</li> <li>An ampersand followed by a minus sign (<code>&amp;-</code>). The file descriptor will be closed.</li> </ul> <p>As a convenience, the redirection <code>&amp;&gt;</code> can be used to direct both stdout and stderr to the same file.</p> <p>Example:</p> <p>To redirect both standard output and standard error to the file 'all_output.txt', you can write <code>echo Hello &amp;&gt; all_output.txt</code>, which is a convenience for <code>echo Hello &gt; all_output.txt 2&gt;&amp;1</code>.</p> <p>Any file descriptor can be redirected in an arbitrary way by prefixing the redirection with the file descriptor.</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>To redirect input of FD N, write <code>N&lt;DESTINATION</code>
</li> <li>To redirect output of FD N, write <code>N&gt;DESTINATION</code>
</li> <li>To append the output of FD N to a file, write <code>N&gt;&gt;DESTINATION_FILE</code>
</li> </ul> <p>Example: <code>echo Hello 2&gt;output.stderr</code> writes the standard error (file descriptor 2) of the target program to <code>output.stderr</code>.</p> <table class="docutils footnote" frame="void" id="id3" rules="none">   <tr>
<td class="label"><a class="fn-backref" href="#id1">[1]</a></td>
<td>Also shortened as "I/O" or "IO".</td>
</tr>  </table> <table class="docutils footnote" frame="void" id="id4" rules="none">   <tr>
<td class="label"><a class="fn-backref" href="#id2">[2]</a></td>
<td>Previous versions of fish also allowed spelling this as <code>^DESTINATION</code>, but that made another character special so it was deprecated and will be removed in future.</td>
</tr>  </table>   <h2 id="piping">Piping</h2> <p>The user can string together multiple commands into a <em>pipeline</em>. This means that the standard output of one command will be read in as standard input into the next command. This is done by separating the commands by the pipe character '<code>|</code>'. For example</p> <pre data-language="fish">cat foo.txt | head
</pre> <p>will call the <code>cat</code> program with the parameter 'foo.txt', which will print the contents of the file 'foo.txt'. The contents of foo.txt will then be filtered through the program 'head', which will pass on the first ten lines of the file to the screen. For more information on how to combine commands through pipes, read the manual pages of the commands you want to use using the <code>man</code> command. If you want to find out more about the <code>cat</code> program, type <code>man cat</code>.</p> <p>Pipes usually connect file descriptor 1 (standard output) of the first process to file descriptor 0 (standard input) of the second process. It is possible to use a different output file descriptor by prepending the desired FD number and then output redirect symbol to the pipe. For example:</p> <pre data-language="fish">make fish 2&gt;| less
</pre> <p>will attempt to build the fish program, and any errors will be shown using the less pager.</p> <p>As a convenience, the pipe <code>&amp;|</code> may be used to redirect both stdout and stderr to the same process. (Note this is different from bash, which uses <code>|&amp;</code>).</p>   <h2 id="syntax-background">Background jobs</h2> <p id="background-jobs">When you start a job in <code>fish</code>, <code>fish</code> itself will pause, and give control of the terminal to the program just started. Sometimes, you want to continue using the commandline, and have the job run in the background. To create a background job, append an &amp; (ampersand) to your command. This will tell fish to run the job in the background. Background jobs are very useful when running programs that have a graphical user interface.</p> <p>Example:</p> <pre data-language="fish">emacs &amp;
</pre> <p>will start the emacs text editor in the background.</p>   <h2 id="syntax-job-control">Job control</h2> <p id="job-control">Most programs allow you to suspend the program's execution and return control to <code>fish</code> by pressing <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Control+Z</kbd> (also referred to as <code>^Z</code>). Once back at the <code>fish</code> commandline, you can start other programs and do anything you want. If you then want you can go back to the suspended command by using the <a class="reference internal" href="cmds/fg#cmd-fg"><span class="std std-ref">fg</span></a> (foreground) command.</p> <p>If you instead want to put a suspended job into the background, use the <a class="reference internal" href="cmds/bg#cmd-bg"><span class="std std-ref">bg</span></a> command.</p> <p>To get a listing of all currently started jobs, use the <a class="reference internal" href="cmds/jobs#cmd-jobs"><span class="std std-ref">jobs</span></a> command. These listed jobs can be removed with the <a class="reference internal" href="cmds/disown#cmd-disown"><span class="std std-ref">disown</span></a> command.</p>   <h2 id="syntax-function">Functions</h2> <p id="functions">Functions are programs written in the fish syntax. They group together one or more commands and their arguments using a single name. It can also be used to start a specific command with additional arguments.</p> <p>For example, the following is a function definition that calls the command <code>ls</code> with the argument '<code>-l</code>' to print a detailed listing of the contents of the current directory:</p> <pre data-language="fish">function ll
    ls -l $argv
end
</pre> <p>The first line tells fish that a function by the name of <code>ll</code> is to be defined. To use it, simply write <code>ll</code> on the commandline. The second line tells fish that the command <code>ls -l $argv</code> should be called when <code>ll</code> is invoked. '<code>$argv</code>' is a list variable, which always contains all arguments sent to the function. In the example above, these are simply passed on to the <code>ls</code> command. For more information on functions, see the documentation for the <a class="reference internal" href="cmds/function#cmd-function"><span class="std std-ref">function</span></a> builtin.</p>   <h2 id="syntax-function-wrappers">Defining aliases</h2> <p id="defining-aliases">One of the most common uses for functions is to slightly alter the behavior of an already existing command. For example, one might want to redefine the <code>ls</code> command to display colors. The switch for turning on colors on GNU systems is '<code>--color=auto</code>'. An alias, or wrapper, around <code>ls</code> might look like this:</p> <pre data-language="fish">function ls
    command ls --color=auto $argv
end
</pre> <p>There are a few important things that need to be noted about aliases:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>Always take care to add the <code>$argv</code> variable to the list of parameters to the wrapped command. This makes sure that if the user specifies any additional parameters to the function, they are passed on to the underlying command.</li> <li>If the alias has the same name as the aliased command, you need to prefix the call to the program with <code>command</code> to tell fish that the function should not call itself, but rather a command with the same name. If you forget to do so, the function would call itself until the end of time. Usually fish is smart enough to figure this out and will refrain from doing so (which is hopefully in your interest).</li> <li>Autoloading isn't applicable to aliases. Since, by definition, the function is created at the time the alias command is executed. You cannot autoload aliases.</li> </ul> <p>To easily create a function of this form, you can use the <a class="reference internal" href="cmds/alias#cmd-alias"><span class="std std-ref">alias</span></a> command.</p>   <h2 id="syntax-function-autoloading">Autoloading functions</h2> <p id="autoloading-functions">Functions can be defined on the commandline or in a configuration file, but they can also be automatically loaded. This has some advantages:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>An autoloaded function becomes available automatically to all running shells.</li> <li>If the function definition is changed, all running shells will automatically reload the altered version.</li> <li>Startup time and memory usage is improved, etc.</li> </ul> <p>When fish needs to load a function, it searches through any directories in the list variable <code>$fish_function_path</code> for a file with a name consisting of the name of the function plus the suffix '<code>.fish</code>' and loads the first it finds.</p> <p>By default <code>$fish_function_path</code> contains the following:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>A directory for end-users to keep their own functions, usually <code>~/.config/fish/functions</code> (controlled by the <code>XDG_CONFIG_HOME</code> environment variable).</li> <li>A directory for systems administrators to install functions for all users on the system, usually <code>/etc/fish/functions</code> (really <code>$__fish_sysconfdir/functions</code>).</li> <li>Directories for third-party software vendors to ship their own functions for their software. Fish searches the directories in the <code>XDG_DATA_DIRS</code> environment variable for a <code>fish/vendor_functions.d</code> directory; if this variable is not defined, the default is usually to search <code>/usr/share/fish/vendor_functions.d</code> and <code>/usr/local/share/fish/vendor_functions.d</code>.</li> <li>The functions shipped with fish, usually installed in <code>/usr/share/fish/functions</code> (really <code>$__fish_data_dir/functions</code>).</li> </ul> <p>These paths are controlled by parameters set at build, install, or run time, and may vary from the defaults listed above.</p> <p>This wide search may be confusing. If you are unsure, your functions probably belong in <code>~/.config/fish/functions</code>.</p> <p>It is very important that function definition files only contain the definition for the specified function and nothing else. Otherwise, it is possible that autoloading a function files requires that the function already be loaded, which creates a circular dependency.</p> <p>Autoloading also won't work for <a class="reference external" href="#event">event handlers</a>, since fish cannot know that a function is supposed to be executed when an event occurs when it hasn't yet loaded the function. See the <a class="reference external" href="#event">event handlers</a> section for more information.</p> <p>Autoloading is not applicable to functions created by the <code>alias</code> command. For functions simple enough that you prefer to use the <code>alias</code> command to define them you'll need to put those commands in your <code>~/.config/fish/config.fish</code> script or some other script run when the shell starts.</p> <p>If you are developing another program, you may wish to install functions which are available for all users of the fish shell on a system. They can be installed to the "vendor" functions directory. As this path may vary from system to system, the <code>pkgconfig</code> framework should be used to discover this path with the output of <code>pkg-config --variable functionsdir fish</code>. Your installation system should support a custom path to override the pkgconfig path, as other distributors may need to alter it easily.</p>   <h2 id="syntax-conditional">Conditional execution of code and flow control</h2> <p id="conditional-execution-of-code-and-flow-control">There are four fish builtins that let you execute commands only if a specific criterion is met. These builtins are <a class="reference internal" href="cmds/if#cmd-if"><span class="std std-ref">if</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="cmds/switch#cmd-switch"><span class="std std-ref">switch</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="cmds/and#cmd-and"><span class="std std-ref">and</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="cmds/or#cmd-or"><span class="std std-ref">or</span></a>.</p> <p>The <code>switch</code> command is used to execute one of possibly many blocks of commands depending on the value of a string. See the documentation for <a class="reference internal" href="cmds/switch#cmd-switch"><span class="std std-ref">switch</span></a> for more information.</p> <p>The other conditionals use the <a class="reference external" href="#variables-status">exit status</a> of a command to decide if a command or a block of commands should be executed. See their documentation for more information.</p>   <h2 id="expand">Parameter expansion (Globbing)</h2> <p id="parameter-expansion-globbing">When an argument for a program is given on the commandline, it undergoes the process of parameter expansion before it is sent on to the command. Parameter expansion is a powerful mechanism that allows you to expand the parameter in various ways, including performing wildcard matching on files, inserting the value of a shell variable into the parameter or even using the output of another command as a parameter list.</p>   <h2 id="expand-wildcard">Wildcards</h2> <p id="wildcards">If a star (<code>*</code>) or a question mark (<code>?</code>) is present in the parameter, <code>fish</code> attempts to match the given parameter to any files in such a way that:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>
<code>*</code> can match any string of characters not containing '/'. This includes matching an empty string.</li> <li>
<code>**</code> matches any string of characters. This includes matching an empty string. The matched string may include the <code>/</code> character; that is, it recurses into subdirectories. Note that augmenting this wildcard with other strings will not match files in the current working directory (<code>$PWD</code>) if you separate the strings with a slash ("/"). This is unlike other shells such as zsh. For example, <code>**\/*.fish</code> in zsh will match <code>.fish</code> files in the PWD but in fish will only match such files in a subdirectory. In fish you should type <code>**.fish</code> to match files in the PWD as well as subdirectories.</li> <li>
<code>?</code> can match any single character except '/'. This is deprecated and can be disabled via the <code>qmark-noglob</code> <a class="reference internal" href="#featureflags"><span class="std std-ref">feature flag</span></a>, so <code>?</code> will just be an ordinary character.</li> </ul> <p>Other shells, such as zsh, provide a rich glob syntax for restricting the files matched by globs. For example, <code>**(.)</code>, to only match regular files. Fish prefers to defer such features to programs, such as <code>find</code>, rather than reinventing the wheel. Thus, if you want to limit the wildcard expansion to just regular files the fish approach is to define and use a function. For example,</p> <pre data-language="fish">function ff --description 'Like ** but only returns plain files.'
    # This also ignores .git directories.
    find . \( -name .git -type d -prune \) -o -type f | \
        sed -n -e '/^\.\/\.git$/n' -e 's/^\.\///p'
end
</pre> <p>You would then use it in place of <code>**</code> like this, <code>my_prog (ff)</code>, to pass only regular files in or below $PWD to <code>my_prog</code>.</p> <p>Wildcard matches are sorted case insensitively. When sorting matches containing numbers, consecutive digits are considered to be one element, so that the strings '1' '5' and '12' would be sorted in the order given.</p> <p>File names beginning with a dot are not considered when wildcarding unless a dot is specifically given as the first character of the file name.</p> <p>Examples:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>
<code>a*</code> matches any files beginning with an 'a' in the current directory.</li> <li>
<code>???</code> matches any file in the current directory whose name is exactly three characters long.</li> <li>
<code>**</code> matches any files and directories in the current directory and all of its subdirectories.</li> </ul> <p>Note that for most commands, if any wildcard fails to expand, the command is not executed, <a class="reference internal" href="#variables-status"><span class="std std-ref">$status</span></a> is set to nonzero, and a warning is printed. This behavior is consistent with setting <code>shopt -s failglob</code> in bash. There are exactly 4 exceptions, namely <a class="reference internal" href="cmds/set#cmd-set"><span class="std std-ref">set</span></a>, overriding variables in <a class="reference internal" href="#variables-override"><span class="std std-ref">overrides</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="cmds/count#cmd-count"><span class="std std-ref">count</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="cmds/for#cmd-for"><span class="std std-ref">for</span></a>. Their globs are permitted to expand to zero arguments, as with <code>shopt -s nullglob</code> in bash.</p> <p>Examples:</p> <pre data-language="fish">ls *.foo
# Lists the .foo files, or warns if there aren't any.

set foos *.foo
if count $foos &gt;/dev/null
    ls $foos
end
# Lists the .foo files, if any.
</pre>   <h2 id="expand-command-substitution">Command substitution</h2> <p id="command-substitution">The output of a series of commands can be used as the parameters to another command. If a parameter contains a set of parenthesis, the text enclosed by the parenthesis will be interpreted as a list of commands. On expansion, this list is executed, and substituted by the output. If the output is more than one line long, each line will be expanded to a new parameter. Setting <code>IFS</code> to the empty string will disable line splitting.</p> <p>If the output is piped to <a class="reference internal" href="cmds/string#cmd-string-split"><span class="std std-ref">string split or string split0</span></a> as the last step, those splits are used as they appear and no additional splitting on newlines takes place.</p> <p>The exit status of the last run command substitution is available in the <a class="reference external" href="#variables-status">status</a> variable if the substitution occurs in the context of a <code>set</code> command.</p> <p>Only part of the output can be used, see <a class="reference external" href="#expand-index-range">index range expansion</a> for details.</p> <p>Fish has a default limit of 100 MiB on the amount of data a command substitution can output. If the limit is exceeded the entire command, not just the substitution, is failed and <code>$status</code> is set to 122. You can modify the limit by setting the <code>fish_read_limit</code> variable at any time including in the environment before fish starts running. If you set it to zero then no limit is imposed. This is a safety mechanism to keep the shell from consuming too much memory if a command outputs an unreasonable amount of data, typically your operating system also has a limit, and it's often much lower. Note that this limit also affects how much data the <code>read</code> command will process.</p> <p>Examples:</p> <pre data-language="fish">echo (basename image.jpg .jpg).png
# Outputs 'image.png'.

for i in *.jpg; convert $i (basename $i .jpg).png; end
# Convert all JPEG files in the current directory to the
# PNG format using the 'convert' program.

begin; set -l IFS; set data (cat data.txt); end
# Set the ``data`` variable to the contents of 'data.txt'
# without splitting it into a list.

set data (cat data | string split0)
# Set ``$data`` to the contents of data, splitting on NUL-bytes.
</pre>   <h2 id="id6">Brace expansion</h2> <p id="expand-brace">A comma separated list of characters enclosed in curly braces will be expanded so each element of the list becomes a new parameter. This is useful to save on typing, and to separate a variable name from surrounding text.</p> <p>Examples:</p> <pre data-language="fish">&gt; echo input.{c,h,txt}
input.c input.h input.txt

&gt; mv *.{c,h} src/
# Moves all files with the suffix '.c' or '.h' to the subdirectory src.

&gt; cp file{,.bak}
# Make a copy of `file` at `file.bak`.

&gt; set -l dogs hot cool cute
&gt; echo {$dogs}dog
hotdog cooldog cutedog
</pre> <p>If two braces do not contain a "," or a variable expansion, they will not be expanded in this manner:</p> <pre data-language="fish">&gt; echo foo-{}
foo-{}
&gt; git reset --hard HEAD@{2}
# passes "HEAD@{2}" to git
&gt; echo {{a,b}}
{a} {b} # because the inner brace pair is expanded, but the outer isn't.
</pre> <p>If after expansion there is nothing between the braces, the argument will be removed (see <a class="reference internal" href="#cartesian-product"><span class="std std-ref">the cartesian product section</span></a>):</p> <pre data-language="fish">&gt; echo foo-{$undefinedvar}
# Output is an empty line, just like a bare `echo`.
</pre> <p>If there is nothing between a brace and a comma or two commas, it's interpreted as an empty element:</p> <pre data-language="fish">&gt; echo {,,/usr}/bin
/bin /bin /usr/bin
</pre> <p>To use a "," as an element, <a class="reference external" href="#quotes">quote</a> or <a class="reference external" href="#escapes">escape</a> it.</p>   <h2 id="id7">Variable expansion</h2> <p id="expand-variable">A dollar sign followed by a string of characters is expanded into the value of the shell variable with the same name. For more on shell variables, read the <a class="reference external" href="#variables">Shell variables</a> section.</p> <p>Examples:</p> <pre data-language="fish">echo $HOME
# Prints the home directory of the current user.
</pre> <p>Undefined and empty variables expand to nothing:</p> <pre data-language="fish">echo $nonexistentvariable
# Prints no output.
</pre> <p>To separate a variable name from text encase the variable within double-quotes or braces:</p> <pre data-language="fish">echo The plural of $WORD is "$WORD"s
# Prints "The plural of cat is cats" when $WORD is set to cat.
echo The plural of $WORD is {$WORD}s
# ditto
</pre> <p>Note that without the quotes or braces, fish will try to expand a variable called <code>$WORDs</code>, which may not exist.</p> <p>The latter syntax <code>{$WORD}</code> works by exploiting <a class="reference external" href="#expand-brace">brace expansion</a>.</p> <p>In these cases, the expansion eliminates the string, as a result of the implicit <a class="reference internal" href="#cartesian-product"><span class="std std-ref">cartesian product</span></a>.</p> <p>If, in the example above, $WORD is undefined or an empty list, the "s" is not printed. However, it is printed if $WORD is the empty string (like after <code>set WORD ""</code>).</p> <p>Unlike all the other expansions, variable expansion also happens in double quoted strings. Inside double quotes (<code>"these"</code>), variables will always expand to exactly one argument. If they are empty or undefined, it will result in an empty string. If they have one element, they'll expand to that element. If they have more than that, the elements will be joined with spaces <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id10" id="id9">[3]</a>.</p> <p>Outside of double quotes, variables will expand to as many arguments as they have elements. That means an empty list will expand to nothing, a variable with one element will expand to that element, and a variable with multiple elements will expand to each of those elements separately.</p> <p>When two unquoted expansions directly follow each other, you need to watch out for expansions that expand to nothing. This includes undefined variables and empty lists, but also command substitutions with no output. See the <a class="reference internal" href="#cartesian-product"><span class="std std-ref">cartesian product</span></a> section for more information.</p> <p>The <code>$</code> symbol can also be used multiple times, as a kind of "dereference" operator (the <code>*</code> in C or C++), like in the following code:</p> <pre data-language="fish">set foo a b c
set a 10; set b 20; set c 30
for i in (seq (count $$foo))
    echo $$foo[$i]
end

# Output is:
# 10
# 20
# 30
</pre> <p>When using this feature together with list brackets, the brackets will always match the innermost <code>$</code> dereference. Thus, <code>$$foo[5]</code> will always mean the fifth element of the <code>foo</code> variable should be dereferenced, not the fifth element of the doubly dereferenced variable <code>foo</code>. The latter can instead be expressed as <code>$$foo[1][5]</code>.</p> <table class="docutils footnote" frame="void" id="id10" rules="none">   <tr>
<td class="label"><a class="fn-backref" href="#id9">[3]</a></td>

</tr>  </table>   <h2 id="cartesian-product">Cartesian Products</h2> <p id="cartesian-products">Lists adjacent to other lists or strings are expanded as cartesian products:</p> <p>Examples:</p> <pre data-language="fish">&gt;_ echo {good,bad}" apples"

1word 2word 3word

&gt;_ echo {$c}word
# Output is an empty line
</pre> <p>Be careful when you try to use braces to separate variable names from text. The problem shown above can be avoided by wrapping the variable in double quotes instead of braces (<code>echo "$c"word</code>).</p> <p>This also happens after <a class="reference external" href="#expand-command-substitution">command substitution</a>. Therefore strings might be eliminated. This can be avoided by making the inner command return a trailing newline.</p> <p>E.g.</p> <pre data-language="fish">&gt;_ echo (printf '%s' '')banana # the printf prints literally nothing
&gt;_ echo (printf '%s\n' '')banana # the printf prints just a newline, so the command substitution expands to an empty string
banana
# After command substitution, the previous line looks like:
&gt;_ echo ""banana
</pre> <p>Examples:</p> <pre data-language="fish">&gt;_ set b 1 2 3
&gt;_ echo (echo x)$b
x1 x2 x3
</pre>   <h2 id="id12">Index range expansion</h2> <p id="expand-index-range">Sometimes it's necessary to access only some of the elements of a list, or some of the lines a command substitution outputs. Both allow this by providing a set of indices in square brackets.</p> <p>Sequences of elements can be written with the range operator '<code>..</code>'. A range '<code>a..b</code>' ('a' and 'b' being integers) is expanded into a sequence of indices '<code>a a+1 a+2 ... b</code>' or '<code>a a-1 a-2 ... b</code>' depending on which of 'a' or 'b' is higher. Negative range limits are calculated from the end of the list. If an index is too large or small it's silently clamped to one or the size of the list as appropriate.</p> <p>If the end is smaller than the start, or the start is larger than the end, range expansion will go in reverse. This is unless exactly one of the given indices is negative, so the direction doesn't change if the list has fewer elements than expected.</p> <p>Some examples:</p> <pre data-language="fish">echo (seq 10)[1 2 3]
# Prints: 1 2 3

# Limit the command substitution output
echo (seq 10)[2..5]
# Uses elements from 2 to 5
# Output is: 2 3 4 5

# Use overlapping ranges:
echo (seq 10)[2..5 1..3]
# Takes elements from 2 to 5 and then elements from 1 to 3
# Output is: 2 3 4 5 1 2 3

# Reverse output
echo (seq 10)[-1..1]
# Uses elements from the last output line to
# the first one in reverse direction
# Output is: 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

# The command substitution has only one line,
# so these will result in empty output:
echo (echo one)[2..-1]
echo (echo one)[-3..1]
</pre> <p>The same works when setting or expanding variables:</p> <pre data-language="fish"># Reverse path variable
set PATH $PATH[-1..1]
# or
set PATH[-1..1] $PATH

# Use only n last items of the PATH
set n -3
echo $PATH[$n..-1]
</pre> <p>Variables can be used as indices for expansion of variables, like so:</p> <pre data-language="fish">set index 2
set letters a b c d
echo $letters[$index] # returns 'b'
</pre> <p>However using variables as indices for command substitution is currently not supported, so:</p> <pre data-language="fish">echo (seq 5)[$index] # This won't work

set sequence (seq 5) # It needs to be written on two lines like this.
echo $sequence[$index] # returns '2'
</pre> <p>When using indirect variable expansion with multiple <code>$</code> (<code>$$name</code>), you have to give all indices up to the variable you want to slice:</p> <pre data-language="fish">&gt; set -l list 1 2 3 4 5
&gt; set -l name list
&gt; echo $$name[1]
1 2 3 4 5
&gt; echo $$name[1..-1][1..3] # or $$name[1][1..3], since $name only has one element.

A block of commands is a series of commands that begins with one of the commands <code>for</code>, <code>while</code> , <code>if</code>, <code>function</code>, <code>begin</code> or <code>switch</code>, and ends with the command <code>end</code>.</li> </ul> <p>Variables can be explicitly set to be universal with the <code>-U</code> or <code>--universal</code> switch, global with the <code>-g</code> or <code>--global</code> switch, or local with the <code>-l</code> or <code>--local</code> switch. The scoping rules when creating or updating a variable are:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>If a variable is explicitly set to a scope (universal, global or local), that setting will be honored. If a variable of the same name exists in a different scope, that variable will not be changed.</li> <li>If a variable is not explicitly set to a scope, but has been previously defined, the variable scope is not changed.</li> <li>If a variable is not explicitly set to a scope and has not been defined, the variable will be local to the currently executing function. Note that this is different from using the <code>-l</code> or <code>--local</code> flag. If one of those flags is used, the variable will be local to the most inner currently executing block, while without these the variable will be local to the function. If no function is executing, the variable will be global.</li> </ul> <p>There may be many variables with the same name, but different scopes. When using a variable, the variable scope will be searched from the inside out, i.e. a local variable will be used rather than a global variable with the same name, a global variable will be used rather than a universal variable with the same name.</p> <p>Example:</p> <p>The following code will not output anything:</p> <pre data-language="fish">begin

In particular, this is necessary for variables used to configure external commands like $LESS or $GOPATH, but also for variables that contain general system settings like $PATH or $LANGUAGE. If an external command needs to know a variable, it needs to be exported.</p> <p>Variables can be explicitly set to be exported with the <code>-x</code> or <code>--export</code> switch, or not exported with the <code>-u</code> or <code>--unexport</code> switch. The exporting rules when setting a variable are identical to the scoping rules for variables:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>If a variable is explicitly set to either be exported or not exported, that setting will be honored.</li> <li>If a variable is not explicitly set to be exported or not exported, but has been previously defined, the previous exporting rule for the variable is kept.</li> <li>Otherwise, by default, the variable will not be exported.</li> <li>If a variable has local scope and is exported, any function called receives a _copy_ of it, so any changes it makes to the variable disappear once the function returns.</li> <li>Global variables are accessible to functions whether they are exported or not.</li> </ul> <p>As a naming convention, exported variables are in uppercase and unexported variables are in lowercase.</p>   <h2 id="variables-lists">Lists</h2> <p id="lists"><code>fish</code> can store a list (or an "array" if you wish) of multiple strings inside of a variable. To access one element of a list, use the index of the element inside of square brackets, like this:</p> <p><code>echo $PATH[3]</code></p> <p>Note that list indices start at 1 in <code>fish</code>, not 0, as is more common in other languages. This is because many common Unix tools like <code>seq</code> are more suited to such use. An invalid index is silently ignored resulting in no value being substituted (not an empty string).</p> <p>If you do not use any brackets, all the elements of the list will be written as separate items. This means you can easily iterate over a list using this syntax:</p> <pre data-language="fish">for i in $PATH; echo $i is in the path; end
</pre> <p>To create a variable <code>smurf</code>, containing the items <code>blue</code> and <code>small</code>, simply write:</p> <pre data-language="fish">set smurf blue small
</pre> <p>It is also possible to set or erase individual elements of a list:</p> <pre data-language="fish"># Set smurf to be a list with the elements 'blue' and 'small'
set smurf blue small

# Change the second element of smurf to 'evil'
set smurf[2] evil

# Erase the first element
set -e smurf[1]

# Output 'evil'
echo $smurf
</pre> <p>If you specify a negative index when expanding or assigning to a list variable, the index will be calculated from the end of the list. For example, the index -1 means the last index of a list.</p> <p>A range of indices can be specified, see <a class="reference external" href="#expand-index-range">index range expansion</a> for details.</p> <p>All lists are one-dimensional and cannot contain other lists, although it is possible to fake nested lists using the dereferencing rules of <a class="reference external" href="#expand-variable">variable expansion</a>.</p> <p>When a list is exported as an environment variable, it is either space or colon delimited, depending on whether it is a path variable:</p> <pre data-language="fish">set -x smurf blue small
set -x smurf_PATH forest mushroom
env | grep smurf

# smurf=blue small
# smurf_PATH=forest:mushroom
</pre> <p><code>fish</code> automatically creates lists from all environment variables whose name ends in PATH, by splitting them on colons. Other variables are not automatically split.</p>   <h2 id="variables-path">PATH variables</h2> <p id="path-variables">Path variables are a special kind of variable used to support colon-delimited path lists including PATH, CDPATH, MANPATH, PYTHONPATH, etc. All variables that end in <code>PATH</code> (case-sensitive) become PATH variables.</p> <p>PATH variables act as normal lists, except they are are implicitly joined and split on colons.</p> <pre data-language="fish">set MYPATH 1 2 3
echo "$MYPATH"
# 1:2:3
set MYPATH "$MYPATH:4:5"
echo $MYPATH
# 1 2 3 4 5
echo "$MYPATH"
# 1:2:3:4:5
</pre> <p>Variables can be marked or unmarked as PATH variables via the <code>--path</code> and <code>--unpath</code> options to <code>set</code>.</p>   <h2 id="variables-special">Special variables</h2> <p id="special-variables">The user can change the settings of <code>fish</code> by changing the values of certain variables.</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>
<code>PATH</code>, a list of directories in which to search for commands</li> <li>
<code>CDPATH</code>, a list of directories in which to search for the new directory for the <code>cd</code> builtin.</li> <li>
<code>LANG</code>, <code>LC_ALL</code>, <code>LC_COLLATE</code>, <code>LC_CTYPE</code>, <code>LC_MESSAGES</code>, <code>LC_MONETARY</code>, <code>LC_NUMERIC</code> and <code>LC_TIME</code> set the language option for the shell and subprograms. See the section <a class="reference external" href="#variables-locale">Locale variables</a> for more information.</li> <li>A large number of variable starting with the prefixes <code>fish_color</code> and <code>fish_pager_color</code>. See <a class="reference external" href="#variables-color">Variables for changing highlighting colors</a> for more information.</li> <li>
<code>fish_emoji_width</code> controls the computed width of certain characters, in particular emoji, whose rendered width changed in Unicode 9 and hence varies across terminal emulators. This should be set to 2 if your terminal emulator supports Unicode &gt;= 9 and renders them double-width, and 1 otherwise. Set this only if you see graphical glitching when printing emoji, typically it will be automatically detected.</li> <li>
<code>fish_ambiguous_width</code> controls the computed width of ambiguous-width characters. This should be set to 1 if your terminal emulator renders these characters as single-width (typical), or 2 if double-width.</li> <li>
<code>fish_escape_delay_ms</code> overrides the default timeout of 30ms after seeing an escape character before giving up on matching a key binding. This is explained in the documentation for the <a class="reference internal" href="cmds/bind#cmd-bind-escape"><span class="std std-ref">bind</span></a> builtin command. This delay facilitates using escape as a meta key.</li> <li>
<code>fish_greeting</code>, the greeting message printed on startup.</li> <li>
<code>fish_history</code>, the current history session name. If set, all subsequent commands within an interactive fish session will be logged to a separate file identified by the value of the variable. If unset, or set to <code>default</code>, the default session name "fish" is used. If set to an empty string, history is not saved to disk (but is still available within the interactive session).</li> <li>
<code>fish_trace</code>, if set and not empty, will cause fish to print commands before they execute, similar to <code>set -x</code> in bash. The trace is printed to the path given by the <a class="reference internal" href="cmds/fish#cmd-fish"><span class="std std-ref">--debug-output</span></a> option to fish (stderr by default).</li> <li>
<code>fish_user_paths</code>, a list of directories that are prepended to <code>PATH</code>. This can be a universal variable.</li> <li>
<code>umask</code>, the current file creation mask. The preferred way to change the umask variable is through the <a class="reference internal" href="cmds/umask#cmd-umask"><span class="std std-ref">umask</span></a> function. An attempt to set umask to an invalid value will always fail.</li> <li>
<code>BROWSER</code>, the user's preferred web browser. If this variable is set, fish will use the specified browser instead of the system default browser to display the fish documentation.</li> </ul> <p><code>fish</code> also sends additional information to the user through the values of certain environment variables. The user cannot change the values of most of these variables.</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>
<code>_</code>, the name of the currently running command (though this is deprecated, and the use of <code>status current-command</code> is preferred).</li> <li>
<code>argv</code>, a list of arguments to the shell or function. <code>argv</code> is only defined when inside a function call, or if fish was invoked with a list of arguments, like <code>fish myscript.fish foo bar</code>. This variable can be changed by the user.</li> <li>
<code>history</code>, a list containing the last commands that were entered.</li> <li>
<code>HOME</code>, the user's home directory. This variable can be changed by the user.</li> <li>
<code>hostname</code>, the machine's hostname.</li> <li>
<code>IFS</code>, the internal field separator that is used for word splitting with the <a class="reference internal" href="cmds/read#cmd-read"><span class="std std-ref">read</span></a> builtin. Setting this to the empty string will also disable line splitting in <a class="reference external" href="#expand-command-substitution">command substitution</a>. This variable can be changed by the user.</li> <li>
<code>PWD</code>, the current working directory.</li> <li>
<code>status</code>, the <a class="reference external" href="#variables-status">exit status</a> of the last foreground job to exit. If the job was terminated through a signal, the exit status will be 128 plus the signal number.</li> <li>
<code>pipestatus</code>, a list of exit statuses of all processes that made up the last executed pipe.</li> <li>
<code>USER</code>, the current username. This variable can be changed by the user.</li> <li>
<code>CMD_DURATION</code>, the runtime of the last command in milliseconds.</li> <li>
<code>version</code>, the version of the currently running fish (also available as <code>FISH_VERSION</code> for backward compatibility).</li> <li>
<code>SHLVL</code>, the level of nesting of shells</li> <li>
<code>COLUMNS</code> and <code>LINES</code>, the current size of the terminal in height and width. These values are only used by fish if the operating system does not report the size of the terminal. Both variables must be set in that case otherwise a default of 80x24 will be used. They are updated when the window size changes.</li> </ul> <p>The names of these variables are mostly derived from the csh family of shells and differ from the ones used by Bourne style shells such as bash.</p> <p>Variables whose name are in uppercase are generally exported to the commands started by fish, while those in lowercase are not exported (<code>CMD_DURATION</code> is an exception, for historical reasons). This rule is not enforced by fish, but it is good coding practice to use casing to distinguish between exported and unexported variables. <code>fish</code> also uses several variables internally. Such variables are prefixed with the string <code>__FISH</code> or <code>__fish.</code> These should never be used by the user. Changing their value may break fish.</p>   <h2 id="variables-status">The status variable</h2> <p id="the-status-variable">Whenever a process exits, an exit status is returned to the program that started it (usually the shell). This exit status is an integer number, which tells the calling application how the execution of the command went. In general, a zero exit status means that the command executed without problem, but a non-zero exit status means there was some form of problem.</p> <p>Fish stores the exit status of the last process in the last job to exit in the <code>status</code> variable.</p> <p>If <code>fish</code> encounters a problem while executing a command, the status variable may also be set to a specific value:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>0 is generally the exit status of fish commands if they successfully performed the requested operation.</li> <li>1 is generally the exit status of fish commands if they failed to perform the requested operation.</li> <li>121 is generally the exit status of fish commands if they were supplied with invalid arguments.</li> <li>123 means that the command was not executed because the command name contained invalid characters.</li> <li>124 means that the command was not executed because none of the wildcards in the command produced any matches.</li> <li>125 means that while an executable with the specified name was located, the operating system could not actually execute the command.</li> <li>126 means that while a file with the specified name was located, it was not executable.</li> <li>127 means that no function, builtin or command with the given name could be located.</li> </ul> <p>If a process exits through a signal, the exit status will be 128 plus the number of the signal.</p>   <h2 id="variables-color">Variables for changing highlighting colors</h2> <p id="variables-for-changing-highlighting-colors">The colors used by fish for syntax highlighting can be configured by changing the values of a various variables. The value of these variables can be one of the colors accepted by the <a class="reference internal" href="cmds/set_color#cmd-set-color"><span class="std std-ref">set_color</span></a> command. The <code>--bold</code> or <code>-b</code> switches accepted by <code>set_color</code> are also accepted.</p> <p>The following variables are available to change the highlighting colors in fish:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>
<code>fish_color_normal</code>, the default color</li> <li>

</pre>   <h2 id="id19">Locale variables</h2> <p id="variables-locale">The most common way to set the locale to use a command like 'set -x LANG en_GB.utf8', which sets the current locale to be the English language, as used in Great Britain, using the UTF-8 character set. For a list of available locales, use 'locale -a'.</p> <p><code>LANG</code>, <code>LC_ALL</code>, <code>LC_COLLATE</code>, <code>LC_CTYPE</code>, <code>LC_MESSAGES</code>, <code>LC_MONETARY</code>, <code>LC_NUMERIC</code> and <code>LC_TIME</code> set the language option for the shell and subprograms. These variables work as follows: <code>LC_ALL</code> forces all the aspects of the locale to the specified value. If <code>LC_ALL</code> is set, all other locale variables will be ignored. The other <code>LC_</code> variables set the specified aspect of the locale information. <code>LANG</code> is a fallback value, it will be used if none of the <code>LC_</code> variables are specified.</p>   <h2 id="builtin-overview">Builtin commands</h2> <p id="builtin-commands">Many other shells have a large library of builtin commands. Most of these commands are also available as standalone commands, but have been implemented in the shell anyway. To avoid code duplication, and to avoid the confusion of subtly differing versions of the same command, <code>fish</code> generally only implements builtins for actions which cannot be performed by a regular command.</p> <p>For a list of all builtins, functions and commands shipped with fish, see the <a class="reference internal" href="https://fishshell.com/docs/3.1/commands.html#commands"><span class="std std-ref">list of commands</span></a>. The documentation is also available by using the <code>--help</code> switch of the command.</p>    <h1 id="interactive-use">Interactive use</h1> <p>Fish prides itself on being really nice to use interactively. That's down to a few features we'll explain in the next few sections.</p>  <h2 id="help">Help</h2> <p><code>fish</code> has an extensive help system. Use the <a class="reference internal" href="cmds/help#cmd-help"><span class="std std-ref">help</span></a> command to obtain help on a specific subject or command. For instance, writing <code>help syntax</code> displays the <a class="reference external" href="#syntax">syntax section</a> of this documentation.</p> <p><code>fish</code> also has man pages for its commands. For example, <code>man set</code> will show the documentation for <code>set</code> as a man page.</p> <p>Help on a specific builtin can also be obtained with the <code>-h</code> parameter. For instance, to obtain help on the <code>fg</code> builtin, either type <code>fg -h</code> or <code>help fg</code>.</p>   <h2 id="autosuggestions">Autosuggestions</h2> <p>fish suggests commands as you type, based on <a class="reference external" href="#history-search">command history</a>, completions, and valid file paths. As you type commands, you will see a suggestion offered after the cursor, in a muted gray color (which can be changed with the <code>fish_color_autosuggestion</code> variable).</p> <p>To accept the autosuggestion (replacing the command line contents), press right arrow or <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Control+F</kbd>. To accept the first suggested word, press <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Alt+→,Right</kbd> or <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Alt+F</kbd>. If the autosuggestion is not what you want, just ignore it: it won't execute unless you accept it.</p> <p>Autosuggestions are a powerful way to quickly summon frequently entered commands, by typing the first few characters. They are also an efficient technique for navigating through directory hierarchies.</p>   <h2 id="tab-completion">Tab Completion</h2> <p>Tab completion is one of the most time saving features of any modern shell. By tapping the tab key, the user asks <code>fish</code> to guess the rest of the command or parameter that the user is currently typing. If <code>fish</code> can only find one possible completion, <code>fish</code> will write it out. If there is more than one completion, <code>fish</code> will write out the longest prefix that all completions have in common. If the completions differ on the first character, a list of all possible completions is printed. The list features descriptions of the completions and if the list doesn't fit the screen, it is scrollable by using the arrow keys, the page up/page down keys, the tab key or the space bar.</p> <p>If the list is visible, pressing control-S (or the <code>pager-toggle-search</code> binding) will allow filtering the list. Shift-tab (or the <code>complete-and-search</code> binding) will trigger completion with the search field immediately visible. These are the general purpose tab completions that <code>fish</code> provides:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>Completion of commands (builtins, functions and regular programs).</li> <li>Completion of shell variable names.</li> <li>Completion of usernames for tilde expansion.</li> <li>Completion of filenames, even on strings with wildcards such as '<code>*</code>' and '<code>**</code>'.</li> </ul> <p><code>fish</code> provides a large number of program specific completions. Most of these completions are simple options like the <code>-l</code> option for <code>ls</code>, but some are more advanced. The latter include:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>The programs <code>man</code> and <code>whatis</code> show all installed manual pages as completions.</li> <li>The <code>make</code> program uses all targets in the Makefile in the current directory as completions.</li> <li>The <code>mount</code> command uses all mount points specified in fstab as completions.</li> <li>The <code>ssh</code> command uses all hosts that are stored in the known_hosts file as completions. (See the ssh documentation for more information)</li> <li>The <code>su</code> command uses all users on the system as completions.</li> <li>The <code>apt-get</code>, <code>rpm</code> and <code>yum</code> commands use all installed packages as completions.</li> </ul>   <h2 id="completion-own">Writing your own completions</h2> <p id="writing-your-own-completions">To specify a completion, use the <code>complete</code> command. <code>complete</code> takes as a parameter the name of the command to specify a completion for. For example, to add a completion for the program <code>myprog</code>, one would start the completion command with <code>complete -c myprog ...</code></p> <p>To provide a list of possible completions for myprog, use the <code>-a</code> switch. If <code>myprog</code> accepts the arguments start and stop, this can be specified as <code>complete -c myprog -a 'start stop'</code>. The argument to the <code>-a</code> switch is always a single string. At completion time, it will be tokenized on spaces and tabs, and variable expansion, command substitution and other forms of parameter expansion will take place.</p> <p><code>fish</code> has a special syntax to support specifying switches accepted by a command. The switches <code>-s</code>, <code>-l</code> and <code>-o</code> are used to specify a short switch (single character, such as <code>-l</code>), a gnu style long switch (such as '<code>--color</code>') and an old-style long switch (like '<code>-shuffle</code>'), respectively. If the command 'myprog' has an option '-o' which can also be written as '<code>--output</code>', and which can take an additional value of either 'yes' or 'no', this can be specified by writing:</p> <pre data-language="fish">complete -c myprog -s o -l output -a "yes no"
</pre> <p>There are also special switches for specifying that a switch requires an argument, to disable filename completion, to create completions that are only available in some combinations, etc.. For a complete description of the various switches accepted by the <code>complete</code> command, see the documentation for the <a class="reference internal" href="cmds/complete#cmd-complete"><span class="std std-ref">complete</span></a> builtin, or write <code>complete --help</code> inside the <code>fish</code> shell.</p> <p>As a more comprehensive example, here's a commented excerpt of the completions for systemd's <code>timedatectl</code>:</p> <pre data-language="fish"># All subcommands that timedatectl knows - this is useful for later.
set -l commands status set-time set-timezone list-timezones set-local-rtc set-ntp

# Disable file completions for the entire command
# because it does not take files anywhere
# Note that this can be undone by using "-F".
#
# File completions also need to be disabled
# if you want to have more control over what files are offered (e.g. just directories, or just files ending in ".mp3").
complete -c timedatectl -f

# This line offers the subcommands
# -"status",
# -"set-timezone",
# -"set-time"
# -"list-timezones"
# if no subcommand has been given so far.
#
# The `-n`/`--condition` option takes script as a string, which it executes.
# If it returns true, the completion is offered.
# Here the condition is the `__fish_seen_subcommands_from` helper function.
# If returns true if any of the given commands is used on the commandline,
# as determined by a simple heuristic.
# For more complex uses, you can write your own function.
# See e.g. the git completions for an example.
#
complete -c timedatectl -n "not __fish_seen_subcommand_from $commands" -a "status set-time set-timezone list-timezones"

# If the "set-timezone" subcommand is used,
# offer the output of `timedatectl list-timezones` as completions.
# Each line of output is used as a separate candidate,
# and anything after a tab is taken as the description.
# It's often useful to transform command output with `string` into that form.
complete -c timedatectl -n "__fish_seen_subcommand_from set-timezone" -a "(timedatectl list-timezones)"

# Completion candidates can also be described via `-d`,
# which is useful if the description is constant.
# Try to keep these short, because that means the user gets to see more at once.
complete -c timedatectl -n "not __fish_seen_subcommand_from $commands" -a "set-local-rtc" -d "Maintain RTC in local time"

# We can also limit options to certain subcommands by using conditions.
complete -c timedatectl -n "__fish_seen_subcommand_from set-local-rtc" -l adjust-system-clock -d 'Synchronize system clock from the RTC'

# These are simple options that can be used everywhere.
complete -c timedatectl -s h -l help -d 'Print a short help text and exit'
complete -c timedatectl -l version -d 'Print a short version string and exit'
complete -c timedatectl -l no-pager -d 'Do not pipe output into a pager'
</pre> <p>For examples of how to write your own complex completions, study the completions in <code>/usr/share/fish/completions</code>. (The exact path depends on your chosen installation prefix and may be slightly different)</p>   <h2 id="completion-func">Useful functions for writing completions</h2> <p id="useful-functions-for-writing-completions"><code>fish</code> ships with several functions that are very useful when writing command specific completions. Most of these functions name begins with the string '<code>__fish_</code>'. Such functions are internal to <code>fish</code> and their name and interface may change in future fish versions. Still, some of them may be very useful when writing completions. A few of these functions are described here. Be aware that they may be removed or changed in future versions of fish.</p> <p>Functions beginning with the string <code>__fish_print_</code> print a newline separated list of strings. For example, <code>__fish_print_filesystems</code> prints a list of all known file systems. Functions beginning with <code>__fish_complete_</code> print out a newline separated list of completions with descriptions. The description is separated from the completion by a tab character.</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>
<code>__fish_complete_directories STRING DESCRIPTION</code> performs path completion on STRING, allowing only directories, and giving them the description DESCRIPTION.</li> <li>
<code>__fish_complete_path STRING DESCRIPTION</code> performs path completion on STRING, giving them the description DESCRIPTION.</li> <li>
<code>__fish_complete_groups</code> prints a list of all user groups with the groups members as description.</li> <li>
<code>__fish_complete_pids</code> prints a list of all processes IDs with the command name as description.</li> <li>
<code>__fish_complete_suffix SUFFIX</code> performs file completion allowing only files ending in SUFFIX, with an optional description.</li> <li>
<code>__fish_complete_users</code> prints a list of all users with their full name as description.</li> <li>
<code>__fish_print_filesystems</code> prints a list of all known file systems. Currently, this is a static list, and not dependent on what file systems the host operating system actually understands.</li> <li>
<code>__fish_print_hostnames</code> prints a list of all known hostnames. This functions searches the fstab for nfs servers, ssh for known hosts and checks the <code>/etc/hosts</code> file.</li> <li>
<code>__fish_print_interfaces</code> prints a list of all known network interfaces.</li> <li>
<code>__fish_print_packages</code> prints a list of all installed packages. This function currently handles Debian, rpm and Gentoo packages.</li> </ul>   <h2 id="completion-path">Where to put completions</h2> <p id="where-to-put-completions">Completions can be defined on the commandline or in a configuration file, but they can also be automatically loaded. Fish automatically searches through any directories in the list variable <code>$fish_complete_path</code>, and any completions defined are automatically loaded when needed. A completion file must have a filename consisting of the name of the command to complete and the suffix '<code>.fish</code>'.</p> <p>By default, Fish searches the following for completions, using the first available file that it finds:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>A directory for end-users to keep their own completions, usually <code>~/.config/fish/completions</code> (controlled by the <code>XDG_CONFIG_HOME</code> environment variable);</li> <li>A directory for systems administrators to install completions for all users on the system, usually <code>/etc/fish/completions</code>;</li> <li>Directories for third-party software vendors to ship their own completions for their software. Fish searches the directories in the <code>XDG_DATA_DIRS</code> environment variable for a <code>fish/vendor_completions.d</code> directory; if this variable is not defined, the default is usually to search <code>/usr/share/fish/vendor_completions.d</code> and <code>/usr/local/share/fish/vendor_completions.d</code>;</li> <li>The completions shipped with fish, usually installed in <code>/usr/share/fish/completions</code>; and</li> <li>Completions automatically generated from the operating system's manuals, usually stored in <code>~/.local/share/fish/generated_completions</code>.</li> </ul> <p>These paths are controlled by parameters set at build, install, or run time, and may vary from the defaults listed above.</p> <p>This wide search may be confusing. If you are unsure, your completions probably belong in <code>~/.config/fish/completions</code>.</p> <p>If you have written new completions for a common Unix command, please consider sharing your work by submitting it via the instructions in <a class="reference external" href="#more-help">Further help and development</a>.</p> <p>If you are developing another program and would like to ship completions with your program, install them to the "vendor" completions directory. As this path may vary from system to system, the pkgconfig framework should be used to discover this path with the output of <code>pkg-config --variable completionsdir fish</code>. Your installation system should support a custom path to override the pkgconfig path, as other distributors may need to alter it easily.</p>    <h1 id="editor">Command line editor</h1> <p id="command-line-editor">The <code>fish</code> editor features copy and paste, a <a class="reference external" href="#history-search">searchable history</a> and many editor functions that can be bound to special keyboard shortcuts.</p> <p>Similar to bash, fish has Emacs and Vi editing modes. The default editing mode is Emacs. You can switch to Vi mode with <code>fish_vi_key_bindings</code> and switch back with <code>fish_default_key_bindings</code>. You can also make your own key bindings by creating a function and setting $fish_key_bindings to its name. For example:</p> <pre data-language="fish">function hybrid_bindings --description "Vi-style bindings that inherit emacs-style bindings in all modes"
    for mode in default insert visual

In such cases, there are several ways in which the user can change fish's behavior.</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>By ending a command with the <code>&amp;</code> (ampersand) symbol, the user tells <code>fish</code> to put the specified command into the background.

Some programs do not support this feature, or remap it to another key. GNU Emacs uses <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Control+X</kbd> <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">z</kbd> to stop running.</li> <li>By using the <a class="reference internal" href="cmds/bg#cmd-bg"><span class="std std-ref">bg</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="cmds/fg#cmd-fg"><span class="std std-ref">fg</span></a> builtin commands, the user can send any currently running job into the foreground or background.</li> </ul> <p>Note that functions cannot be started in the background.

This is so users can copy snippets and override some of their behavior.</p> <p>These files are all executed on the startup of every shell. If you want to run a command only on starting an interactive shell, use the exit status of the command <code>status --is-interactive</code> to determine if the shell is interactive. If you want to run a command only when using a login shell, use <code>status --is-login</code> instead. This will speed up the starting of non-interactive or non-login shells.</p> <p>If you are developing another program, you may wish to install configuration which is run for all users of the fish shell on a system. This is discouraged; if not carefully written, they may have side-effects or slow the startup of the shell. Additionally, users of other shells will not benefit from the Fish-specific configuration. However, if they are absolutely required, you may install them to the "vendor" configuration directory. As this path may vary from system to system, the <code>pkgconfig</code> framework should be used to discover this path with the output of <code>pkg-config --variable confdir fish</code>.</p> <p>Examples:</p> <p>If you want to add the directory <code>~/linux/bin</code> to your PATH variable when using a login shell, add the following to your <code>~/.config/fish/config.fish</code> file:</p> <pre data-language="fish">if status --is-login

The <code>status current-command</code> builtin will always return the name of the job to be put into the foreground (or 'fish' if control is returning to the shell) when the <code>fish_prompt</code> function is called. The first argument to fish_title will contain the most recently executed foreground command as a string, starting with fish 2.2.</p> <p>Examples: The default <code>fish</code> title is:</p> <pre data-language="fish">function fish_title
    echo (status current-command) ' '
    pwd
end
</pre> <p>To show the last command in the title:</p> <pre data-language="fish">function fish_title
    echo $argv[1]
end
</pre>   <h2 id="prompt">Programmable prompt</h2> <p id="programmable-prompt">When fish waits for input, it will display a prompt by evaluating the <code>fish_prompt</code> and <code>fish_right_prompt</code> functions. The output of the former is displayed on the left and the latter's output on the right side of the terminal. The output of <code>fish_mode_prompt</code> will be prepended on the left, though the default function only does this when in <a class="reference external" href="#vi-mode">vi-mode</a>.</p>   <h2 id="greeting">Configurable greeting</h2> <p id="configurable-greeting">If a function named <code>fish_greeting</code> exists, it will be run when entering interactive mode. Otherwise, if an environment variable named <code>fish_greeting</code> exists, it will be printed.</p>   <h2 id="id35">Private mode</h2> <p id="private-mode">fish supports launching in private mode via <code>fish --private</code> (or <code>fish -P</code> for short). In private mode, old history is not available and any interactive commands you execute will not be appended to the global history file, making it useful both for avoiding inadvertently leaking personal information (e.g. for screencasts) and when dealing with sensitive information to prevent it being persisted to disk. You can query the global variable <code>fish_private_mode`</code> (<code>if set -q fish_private_mode ...</code>) if you would like to respect the user's wish for privacy and alter the behavior of your own fish scripts.</p>   <h2 id="id36">Event handlers</h2> <p id="event">When defining a new function in fish, it is possible to make it into an event handler, i.e. a function that is automatically run when a specific event takes place. Events that can trigger a handler currently are:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>When a signal is delivered</li> <li>When a process or job exits</li> <li>When the value of a variable is updated</li> <li>When the prompt is about to be shown</li> <li>When a command lookup fails</li> </ul> <p>Example:</p> <p>To specify a signal handler for the WINCH signal, write:</p> <pre data-language="fish">function my_signal_handler --on-signal WINCH
    echo Got WINCH signal!
end
</pre> <p>Please note that event handlers only become active when a function is loaded, which means you might need to otherwise <a class="reference internal" href="cmds/source#cmd-source"><span class="std std-ref">source</span></a> or execute a function instead of relying on <a class="reference internal" href="#syntax-function-autoloading"><span class="std std-ref">autoloading</span></a>. One approach is to put it into your <a class="reference internal" href="#initialization"><span class="std std-ref">initialization file</span></a>.</p> <p>For more information on how to define new event handlers, see the documentation for the <a class="reference internal" href="cmds/function#cmd-function"><span class="std std-ref">function</span></a> command.</p>   <h2 id="debugging">Debugging fish scripts</h2> <p id="debugging-fish-scripts">Fish includes a built in debugging facility. The debugger allows you to stop execution of a script at an arbitrary point. When this happens you are presented with an interactive prompt. At this prompt you can execute any fish command (there are no debug commands as such). For example, you can check or change the value of any variables using <code>printf</code> and <code>set</code>. As another example, you can run <code>status print-stack-trace</code> to see how this breakpoint was reached. To resume normal execution of the script, simply type <code>exit</code> or [ctrl-D].</p> <p>To start a debug session simply run the builtin command <code>breakpoint</code> at the point in a function or script where you wish to gain control. Also, the default action of the TRAP signal is to call this builtin. So a running script can be debugged by sending it the TRAP signal with the <code>kill</code> command. Once in the debugger, it is easy to insert new breakpoints by using the funced function to edit the definition of a function.</p>    <h1 id="id37">Further help and development</h1> <p id="more-help">If you have a question not answered by this documentation, there are several avenues for help:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>The official mailing list at <a class="reference external" href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/fish-users">fish-users@lists.sourceforge.net</a>
