<h1>Choosing the Right Storage Engine</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p> A high-level overview of the main reasons for choosing a particular storage engine:</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="topic-list">Topic List</h2> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="general-purpose">General Purpose</h3> <ul start="1">
<li>
<a href="../xtradb/index">XtraDB</a> is the best choice in the majority of cases until <a href="../what-is-mariadb-101/index">MariaDB 10.1</a>. It is a performance-enhanced fork of InnoDB and is MariaDB's default engine until <a href="../what-is-mariadb-101/index">MariaDB 10.1</a>. </li>
<li>
<a href="../innodb/index">InnoDB</a> is a good general transaction storage engine. It is the default storage engine from <a href="../what-is-mariadb-102/index">MariaDB 10.2</a> (as well as MySQL). For earlier releases, XtraDB is a performance enhanced fork of InnoDB and is usually preferred. </li>
<li>
<a href="../aria/index">Aria</a>, MariaDB's more modern improvement on <a href="../myisam/index">MyISAM</a>, has a small footprint and allows for easy copying between systems. </li>
<li>
<a href="../myisam/index">MyISAM</a> has a small footprint and allows for easy copying between systems. MyISAM is MySQL's oldest storage engine. There is usually little reason to use it except for legacy purposes. Aria is MariaDB's more modern improvement. </li>
</ul> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="scaling-partitioning">Scaling, Partitioning</h3> <p>When you want to split your database load on several servers or optimize for scaling. We also suggest looking at <a href="../galera/index">Galera</a>, a synchronous multi-master cluster.</p> <ul>
<li>
<a href="../tokudb/index">TokuDB</a> is a transactional storage engine which is optimized for workloads that do not fit in memory, and provides a good compression ratio. </li>
<li>
<a href="../spider/index">Spider</a> uses partitioning to provide data sharding through multiple servers. </li>
<li>
<a href="../columnstore/index">ColumnStore</a> utilizes a massively parallel distributed data architecture and is designed for big data scaling to process petabytes of data. </li>
<li>The <a href="../merge/index">MERGE</a> storage engine is a collection of identical <a href="../myisam/index">MyISAM</a> tables that can be used as one. "Identical" means that all tables have identical column and index information. </li>
</ul> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="compression-archive">Compression / Archive</h3> <ul>
<li>
<a href="../myrocks/index">MyRocks</a> enables greater compression than InnoDB, as well as less write amplification giving better endurance of flash storage and improving overall throughput. </li>
<li>
<a href="../tokudb/index">TokuDB</a> is a transactional storage engine which is optimized for workloads that do not fit in memory, and provides a good compression ratio. </li>
<li>The <a href="../archive/index">Archive</a> storage engine is, unsurprisingly, best used for archiving. </li>

<li>
<a href="../connect/index">CONNECT</a> allows access to different kinds of text files and remote resources as if they were regular MariaDB tables. </li>
<li>The <a href="../csv/index">CSV</a> storage engine can read and append to files stored in CSV (comma-separated-values) format. However, since <a href="../what-is-mariadb-100/index">MariaDB 10.0</a>, CONNECT is a better choice and is more flexibly able to read and write such files. </li>
<li>
<a href="../federatedx/index">FederatedX</a> uses libmysql to talk to the data source, the data source being a remote RDBMS. Currently, since FederatedX only uses libmysql, it can only talk to another MySQL RDBMS. </li>
<li>
<a href="../cassandrase/index">CassandraSE</a> is a storage engine allowing access to an older version of Apache Cassandra NoSQL DBMS. It was relatively experimental, and is no longer being actively developed. </li>
</ul> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="search-optimized">Search Optimized</h3> <p>Search engines optimized for search. </p> <ul>

<a href="../memory-storage-engine/index">MEMORY</a> does not write data on-disk (all rows are lost on crash) and is best-used for read-only caches of data from other tables, or for temporary work areas.

<li>The <a href="../blackhole/index">BLACKHOLE</a> storage engine accepts data but does not store it and always returns an empty result.
