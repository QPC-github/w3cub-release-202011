<h1 id="page-subtitle">function update_calculate_project_update_status</h1>     <pre class="signature">update_calculate_project_update_status(&amp;$project_data, $available)</pre> <p>Calculates the current update status of a specific project.</p> <p>This function is the heart of the update status feature. For each project it is invoked with, it first checks if the project has been flagged with a special status like "unsupported" or "insecure", or if the project node itself has been unpublished. In any of those cases, the project is marked with an error and the next project is considered.</p> <p>If the project itself is valid, the function decides what major release series to consider. The project defines what the currently supported major versions are for each version of core, so the first step is to make sure the current version is still supported. If so, that's the target version. If the current version is unsupported, the project maintainer's recommended major version is used. There's also a check to make sure that this function never recommends an earlier release than the currently installed major version.</p> <p>Given a target major version, the available releases are scanned looking for the specific release to recommend (avoiding beta releases and development snapshots if possible). For the target major version, the highest patch level is found. If there is a release at that patch level with no extra ("beta", etc.), then the release at that patch level with the most recent release date is recommended. If every release at that patch level has extra (only betas), then the latest release from the previous patch level is recommended. For example:</p> <ul> <li>1.6-bugfix &lt;-- recommended version because 1.6 already exists.</li> <li>1.6</li> </ul> <p>or</p> <ul> <li>1.6-beta</li> <li>1.5 &lt;-- recommended version because no 1.6 exists.</li> <li>1.4</li> </ul> <p>Also, the latest release from the same major version is looked for, even beta releases, to display to the user as the "Latest version" option. Additionally, the latest official release from any higher major versions that have been released is searched for to provide a set of "Also available" options.</p> <p>Finally, and most importantly, the release history continues to be scanned until the currently installed release is reached, searching for anything marked as a security update. If any security updates have been found between the recommended release and the installed version, all of the releases that included a security fix are recorded so that the site administrator can be warned their site is insecure, and links pointing to the release notes for each security update can be included (which, in turn, will link to the official security announcements for each vulnerability).</p> <p>This function relies on the fact that the .xml release history data comes sorted based on major version and patch level, then finally by release date if there are multiple releases such as betas from the same major.patch version (e.g., 5.x-1.5-beta1, 5.x-1.5-beta2, and 5.x-1.5). Development snapshots for a given major version are always listed last.</p> <h3>Parameters</h3> <p> <strong>$project_data</strong>: An array containing information about a specific project.</p> <p><strong>$available</strong>: Data about available project releases of a specific project.</p>  <h3>File</h3>
