<h1 class="title">Nim Manual</h1>  
<blockquote><p>"Complexity" seems to be a lot like "energy": you can transfer it from the end user to one/some of the other players, but the total amount seems to remain pretty much constant for a given task. -- Ran</p></blockquote> <h2 id="about-this-document">About this document</h2>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This document is a draft! Several of Nim's features may need more precise wording. This manual is constantly evolving into a proper specification.</p> <p>This document describes the lexis, the syntax, and the semantics of Nim.</p> <p>The language constructs are explained using an extended BNF, in which <code>(a)*</code> means 0 or more <code>a</code>'s, <code>a+</code> means 1 or more <code>a</code>'s, and <code>(a)?</code> means an optional <em>a</em>. Parentheses may be used to group elements.</p> <p><code>&amp;</code> is the lookahead operator; <code>&amp;a</code> means that an <code>a</code> is expected but not consumed. It will be consumed in the following rule.</p> <p>The <code>|</code>, <code>/</code> symbols are used to mark alternatives and have the lowest precedence. <code>/</code> is the ordered choice that requires the parser to try the alternatives in the given order. <code>/</code> is often used to ensure the grammar is not ambiguous.</p> <p>Non-terminals start with a lowercase letter, abstract terminal symbols are in UPPERCASE. Verbatim terminal symbols (including keywords) are quoted with <code>'</code>. An example:</p>
<pre data-language="nim">ifStmt = 'if' expr ':' stmts ('elif' expr ':' stmts)* ('else' stmts)?</pre> <p>The binary <code>^*</code> operator is used as a shorthand for 0 or more occurrences separated by its second argument; likewise <code>^+</code> means 1 or more occurrences: <code>a ^+ b</code> is short for <code>a (b a)*</code> and <code>a ^* b</code> is short for <code>(a (b a)*)?</code>. Example:</p>
<pre data-language="nim">arrayConstructor = '[' expr ^* ',' ']'</pre> <p>Other parts of Nim - like scoping rules or runtime semantics are only described in the, more easily comprehensible, informal manner for now.</p> <h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>
<p>A Nim program specifies a computation that acts on a memory consisting of components called <span id="locations_1">locations</span>. A variable is basically a name for a location. Each variable and location is of a certain <span id="type_1">type</span>. The variable's type is called <span id="static-type_1">static type</span>, the location's type is called <span id="dynamic-type_1">dynamic type</span>. If the static type is not the same as the dynamic type, it is a super-type or subtype of the dynamic type.</p> <p>An <span id="identifier_1">identifier</span> is a symbol declared as a name for a variable, type, procedure, etc. The region of the program over which a declaration applies is called the <span id="scope_1">scope</span> of the declaration. Scopes can be nested. The meaning of an identifier is determined by the smallest enclosing scope in which the identifier is declared unless overloading resolution rules suggest otherwise.</p> <p>An expression specifies a computation that produces a value or location. Expressions that produce locations are called <span id="lminusvalues_1">l-values</span>. An l-value can denote either a location or the value the location contains, depending on the context. Expressions whose values can be determined statically are called <span id="constant-expressions_1">constant expressions</span>; they are never l-values.</p> <p>A <span id="static-error_1">static error</span> is an error that the implementation detects before program execution. Unless explicitly classified, an error is a static error.</p> <p>A <span id="checked-runtime-error_1">checked runtime error</span> is an error that the implementation detects and reports at runtime. The method for reporting such errors is via <em>raising exceptions</em> or <em>dying with a fatal error</em>. However, the implementation provides a means to disable these runtime checks. See the section <a href="#pragmas">pragmas</a> for details.</p> <p>Whether a checked runtime error results in an exception or in a fatal error at runtime is implementation specific. Thus the following program is always invalid:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">var a: array[0..1, char]
let i = 5
try:
  a[i] = 'N'
except IndexError:
  echo "invalid index"</pre>
<p>An <span id="unchecked-runtime-error_1">unchecked runtime error</span> is an error that is not guaranteed to be detected, and can cause the subsequent behavior of the computation to be arbitrary. Unchecked runtime errors cannot occur if only <span id="safe_1">safe</span> language features are used.</p> <h2 id="lexical-analysis">Lexical Analysis</h2> <h3 id="lexical-analysis-encoding">Encoding</h3>
<p>All Nim source files are in the UTF-8 encoding (or its ASCII subset). Other encodings are not supported. Any of the standard platform line termination sequences can be used - the Unix form using ASCII LF (linefeed), the Windows form using the ASCII sequence CR LF (return followed by linefeed), or the old Macintosh form using the ASCII CR (return) character. All of these forms can be used equally, regardless of platform.</p> <h3 id="lexical-analysis-indentation">Indentation</h3>
<p>Nim's standard grammar describes an <span id="indentation-sensitive_1">indentation sensitive</span> language. This means that all the control structures are recognized by indentation. Indentation consists only of spaces; tabulators are not allowed.</p> <p>The indentation handling is implemented as follows: The lexer annotates the following token with the preceding number of spaces; indentation is not a separate token. This trick allows parsing of Nim with only 1 token of lookahead.</p> <p>The parser uses a stack of indentation levels: the stack consists of integers counting the spaces. The indentation information is queried at strategic places in the parser but ignored otherwise: The pseudo terminal <code>IND{&gt;}</code> denotes an indentation that consists of more spaces than the entry at the top of the stack; <code>IND{=}</code> an indentation that has the same number of spaces. <code>DED</code> is another pseudo terminal that describes the <em>action</em> of popping a value from the stack, <code>IND{&gt;}</code> then implies to push onto the stack.</p> <p>With this notation we can now easily define the core of the grammar: A block of statements (simplified example):</p>
<pre data-language="nim">ifStmt = 'if' expr ':' stmt
         (IND{=} 'elif' expr ':' stmt)*
         (IND{=} 'else' ':' stmt)?

simpleStmt = ifStmt / ...

stmt = IND{&gt;} stmt ^+ IND{=} DED  # list of statements
     / simpleStmt                 # or a simple statement</pre> <h3 id="lexical-analysis-comments">Comments</h3>
<p>Comments start anywhere outside a string or character literal with the hash character <code>#</code>. Comments consist of a concatenation of <span id="comment-pieces_1">comment pieces</span>. A comment piece starts with <code>#</code> and runs until the end of the line. The end of line characters belong to the piece. If the next line only consists of a comment piece with no other tokens between it and the preceding one, it does not start a new comment:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">i = 0     # This is a single comment over multiple lines.
  # The scanner merges these two pieces.
  # The comment continues here.</pre>
<p><span id="documentation-comments_1">Documentation comments</span> are comments that start with two <code>##</code>. Documentation comments are tokens; they are only allowed at certain places in the input file as they belong to the syntax tree!</p> <h3 id="lexical-analysis-multiline-comments">Multiline comments</h3>
<p>Starting with version 0.13.0 of the language Nim supports multiline comments. They look like:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">#[Comment here.
Multiple lines
are not a problem.]#</pre>
<p>Multiline comments support nesting:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">#[  #[ Multiline comment in already
   commented out code. ]#
proc p[T](x: T) = discard
]#</pre>
<p>Multiline documentation comments also exist and support nesting too:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc foo =
  ##[Long documentation comment
  here.
  ]##</pre> <h3 id="lexical-analysis-identifiers-amp-keywords">Identifiers &amp; Keywords</h3>
<p>Identifiers in Nim can be any string of letters, digits and underscores, beginning with a letter. Two immediate following underscores <code>__</code> are not allowed:</p>
<pre data-language="nim">letter ::= 'A'..'Z' | 'a'..'z' | '\x80'..'\xff'
digit ::= '0'..'9'
IDENTIFIER ::= letter ( ['_'] (letter | digit) )*</pre> <p>Currently any Unicode character with an ordinal value &gt; 127 (non ASCII) is classified as a <code>letter</code> and may thus be part of an identifier but later versions of the language may assign some Unicode characters to belong to the operator characters instead.</p> <p>The following keywords are reserved and cannot be used as identifiers:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">addr and as asm
bind block break
case cast concept const continue converter
defer discard distinct div do
elif else end enum except export
finally for from func
if import in include interface is isnot iterator
let
macro method mixin mod
nil not notin
object of or out
proc ptr
raise ref return
shl shr static
template try tuple type
using
var
when while
xor
yield</pre>
<p>Some keywords are unused; they are reserved for future developments of the language.</p> <h3 id="lexical-analysis-identifier-equality">Identifier equality</h3>
<p>Two identifiers are considered equal if the following algorithm returns true:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc sameIdentifier(a, b: string): bool =
  a[0] == b[0] and
    a.replace("_", "").toLowerAscii == b.replace("_", "").toLowerAscii</pre>
<p>That means only the first letters are compared in a case sensitive manner. Other letters are compared case insensitively within the ASCII range and underscores are ignored.</p> <p>This rather unorthodox way to do identifier comparisons is called <span id="partial-case-insensitivity_1">partial case insensitivity</span> and has some advantages over the conventional case sensitivity:</p> <p>It allows programmers to mostly use their own preferred spelling style, be it humpStyle or snake_style, and libraries written by different programmers cannot use incompatible conventions. A Nim-aware editor or IDE can show the identifiers as preferred. Another advantage is that it frees the programmer from remembering the exact spelling of an identifier. The exception with respect to the first letter allows common code like <code>var foo: Foo</code> to be parsed unambiguously.</p> <p>Historically, Nim was a fully <span id="styleminusinsensitive_1">style-insensitive</span> language. This meant that it was not case-sensitive and underscores were ignored and there was not even a distinction between <code>foo</code> and <code>Foo</code>.</p> <h3 id="lexical-analysis-string-literals">String literals</h3>
<p>Terminal symbol in the grammar: <code>STR_LIT</code>.</p> <p>String literals can be delimited by matching double quotes, and can contain the following <span id="escape-sequences_1">escape sequences</span>:</p> <table>
<tr>
<th>Escape sequence</th>

<p>Strings in Nim may contain any 8-bit value, even embedded zeros. However some operations may interpret the first binary zero as a terminator.</p> <h3 id="lexical-analysis-triple-quoted-string-literals">Triple quoted string literals</h3>
<p>Terminal symbol in the grammar: <code>TRIPLESTR_LIT</code>.</p> <p>String literals can also be delimited by three double quotes <code>"""</code> ... <code>"""</code>. Literals in this form may run for several lines, may contain <code>"</code> and do not interpret any escape sequences. For convenience, when the opening <code>"""</code> is followed by a newline (there may be whitespace between the opening <code>"""</code> and the newline), the newline (and the preceding whitespace) is not included in the string. The ending of the string literal is defined by the pattern <code>"""[^"]</code>, so this:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">""""long string within quotes""""</pre>
<p>Produces:</p>
<pre data-language="nim">"long string within quotes"</pre> <h3 id="lexical-analysis-raw-string-literals">Raw string literals</h3>
<p>Terminal symbol in the grammar: <code>RSTR_LIT</code>.</p> <p>There are also raw string literals that are preceded with the letter <code>r</code> (or <code>R</code>) and are delimited by matching double quotes (just like ordinary string literals) and do not interpret the escape sequences. This is especially convenient for regular expressions or Windows paths:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">var f = openFile(r"C:\texts\text.txt") # a raw string, so ``\t`` is no tab</pre>
<p>To produce a single <code>"</code> within a raw string literal, it has to be doubled:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">r"a""b"</pre>
<p>Produces:</p>
<pre data-language="nim">a"b</pre> <p><code>r""""</code> is not possible with this notation, because the three leading quotes introduce a triple quoted string literal. <code>r"""</code> is the same as <code>"""</code> since triple quoted string literals do not interpret escape sequences either.</p> <h3 id="lexical-analysis-generalized-raw-string-literals">Generalized raw string literals</h3>
<p>Terminal symbols in the grammar: <code>GENERALIZED_STR_LIT</code>, <code>GENERALIZED_TRIPLESTR_LIT</code>.</p> <p>The construct <code>identifier"string literal"</code> (without whitespace between the identifier and the opening quotation mark) is a generalized raw string literal. It is a shortcut for the construct <code>identifier(r"string literal")</code>, so it denotes a procedure call with a raw string literal as its only argument. Generalized raw string literals are especially convenient for embedding mini languages directly into Nim (for example regular expressions).</p> <p>The construct <code>identifier"""string literal"""</code> exists too. It is a shortcut for <code>identifier("""string literal""")</code>.</p> <h3 id="lexical-analysis-character-literals">Character literals</h3>
<p>Character literals are enclosed in single quotes <code>''</code> and can contain the same escape sequences as strings - with one exception: the platform dependent <span id="newline_2">newline</span> (<code>\p</code>) is not allowed as it may be wider than one character (often it is the pair CR/LF for example). Here are the valid <span id="escape-sequences_2">escape sequences</span> for character literals:</p> <table>

<p>A character is not an Unicode character but a single byte. The reason for this is efficiency: for the overwhelming majority of use-cases, the resulting programs will still handle UTF-8 properly as UTF-8 was specially designed for this. Another reason is that Nim can thus support <code>array[char, int]</code> or <code>set[char]</code> efficiently as many algorithms rely on this feature. The <em>Rune</em> type is used for Unicode characters, it can represent any Unicode character. <code>Rune</code> is declared in the <a href="unicode">unicode module</a>.</p> <h3 id="lexical-analysis-numerical-constants">Numerical constants</h3>
<p>Numerical constants are of a single type and have the form:</p>
<pre data-language="nim">hexdigit = digit | 'A'..'F' | 'a'..'f'
octdigit = '0'..'7'
bindigit = '0'..'1'
HEX_LIT = '0' ('x' | 'X' ) hexdigit ( ['_'] hexdigit )*
DEC_LIT = digit ( ['_'] digit )*
OCT_LIT = '0' 'o' octdigit ( ['_'] octdigit )*
BIN_LIT = '0' ('b' | 'B' ) bindigit ( ['_'] bindigit )*

INT_LIT = HEX_LIT
        | DEC_LIT
        | OCT_LIT
        | BIN_LIT

INT8_LIT = INT_LIT ['\''] ('i' | 'I') '8'
INT16_LIT = INT_LIT ['\''] ('i' | 'I') '16'
INT32_LIT = INT_LIT ['\''] ('i' | 'I') '32'
INT64_LIT = INT_LIT ['\''] ('i' | 'I') '64'

UINT_LIT = INT_LIT ['\''] ('u' | 'U')
UINT8_LIT = INT_LIT ['\''] ('u' | 'U') '8'
UINT16_LIT = INT_LIT ['\''] ('u' | 'U') '16'
UINT32_LIT = INT_LIT ['\''] ('u' | 'U') '32'
UINT64_LIT = INT_LIT ['\''] ('u' | 'U') '64'

exponent = ('e' | 'E' ) ['+' | '-'] digit ( ['_'] digit )*
FLOAT_LIT = digit (['_'] digit)* (('.' digit (['_'] digit)* [exponent]) |exponent)

FLOAT64_LIT = HEX_LIT '\'' FLOAT64_SUFFIX
            | (FLOAT_LIT | DEC_LIT | OCT_LIT | BIN_LIT) ['\''] FLOAT64_SUFFIX</pre> <p>As can be seen in the productions, numerical constants can contain underscores for readability. Integer and floating point literals may be given in decimal (no prefix), binary (prefix <code>0b</code>), octal (prefix <code>0o</code>) and hexadecimal (prefix <code>0x</code>) notation.</p> <p>There exists a literal for each numerical type that is defined. The suffix starting with an apostrophe (''') is called a <span id="type-suffix_1">type suffix</span>. Literals without a type suffix are of an integer type, unless the literal contains a dot or <code>E|e</code> in which case it is of type <code>float</code>. This integer type is <code>int</code> if the literal is in the range <code>low(i32)..high(i32)</code>, otherwise it is <code>int64</code>. For notational convenience the apostrophe of a type suffix is optional if it is not ambiguous (only hexadecimal floating point literals with a type suffix can be ambiguous).</p> <p>The type suffixes are:</p> <table>

<p>Floating point literals may also be in binary, octal or hexadecimal notation: <code>0B0_10001110100_0000101001000111101011101111111011000101001101001001'f64</code> is approximately 1.72826e35 according to the IEEE floating point standard.</p> <p>Literals are bounds checked so that they fit the datatype. Non base-10 literals are used mainly for flags and bit pattern representations, therefore bounds checking is done on bit width, not value range. If the literal fits in the bit width of the datatype, it is accepted. Hence: 0b10000000'u8 == 0x80'u8 == 128, but, 0b10000000'i8 == 0x80'i8 == -1 instead of causing an overflow error.</p> <h3 id="lexical-analysis-operators">Operators</h3>
<p>Nim allows user defined operators. An operator is any combination of the following characters:</p>

<p>This section lists Nim's standard syntax. How the parser handles the indentation is already described in the <a href="#lexical-analysis">Lexical Analysis</a> section.</p> <p>Nim allows user-definable operators. Binary operators have 11 different levels of precedence.</p> <h3 id="syntax-associativity">Associativity</h3>
<p>Binary operators whose first character is <code>^</code> are right-associative, all other binary operators are left-associative.</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc `^/`(x, y: float): float =
  # a right-associative division operator
  result = x / y
echo 12 ^/ 4 ^/ 8 # 24.0 (4 / 8 = 0.5, then 12 / 0.5 = 24.0)

<p>Unary operators always bind stronger than any binary operator: <code>$a + b</code> is <code>($a) + b</code> and not <code>$(a + b)</code>.</p> <p>If an unary operator's first character is <code>@</code> it is a <span id="sigilminuslike_1">sigil-like</span> operator which binds stronger than a <code>primarySuffix</code>: <code>@x.abc</code> is parsed as <code>(@x).abc</code> whereas <code>$x.abc</code> is parsed as <code>$(x.abc)</code>.</p> <p>For binary operators that are not keywords the precedence is determined by the following rules:</p> <p>Operators ending in either <code>-&gt;</code>, <code>~&gt;</code> or <code>=&gt;</code> are called <span id="arrow-like_1">arrow like</span>, and have the lowest precedence of all operators.</p> <p>If the operator ends with <code>=</code> and its first character is none of <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>!</code>, <code>=</code>, <code>~</code>, <code>?</code>, it is an <em>assignment operator</em> which has the second lowest precedence.</p> <p>Otherwise precedence is determined by the first character.</p> <table>

<p>All expressions have a type which is known at compile time. Nim is statically typed. One can declare new types, which is in essence defining an identifier that can be used to denote this custom type.</p> <p>These are the major type classes:</p> <ul class="simple">
<li>ordinal types (consist of integer, bool, character, enumeration (and subranges thereof) types)</li> <li>floating point types</li> <li>string type</li> <li>structured types</li> <li>reference (pointer) type</li> <li>procedural type</li> <li>generic type</li> </ul> <h3 id="types-ordinal-types">Ordinal types</h3>
<p>Ordinal types have the following characteristics:</p> <ul class="simple">
<li>Ordinal types are countable and ordered. This property allows the operation of functions as <code>inc</code>, <code>ord</code>, <code>dec</code> on ordinal types to be defined.</li> <li>Ordinal values have a smallest possible value. Trying to count further down than the smallest value gives a checked runtime or static error.</li> <li>Ordinal values have a largest possible value. Trying to count further than the largest value gives a checked runtime or static error.</li> </ul> <p>Integers, bool, characters and enumeration types (and subranges of these types) belong to ordinal types. For reasons of simplicity of implementation the types <code>uint</code> and <code>uint64</code> are not ordinal types.</p> <h3 id="types-preminusdefined-integer-types">Pre-defined integer types</h3>
<p>These integer types are pre-defined:</p> <dl>
<dt><code>int</code></dt> <dd>the generic signed integer type; its size is platform dependent and has the same size as a pointer. This type should be used in general.

Literals of these types have the suffix 'iXX.</dd> <dt><code>uint</code></dt> <dd>the generic <span id="unsigned-integer_1">unsigned integer</span> type; its size is platform dependent and has the same size as a pointer. An integer literal with the type suffix <code>'u</code> is of this type.</dd> <dt>uintXX</dt> <dd>additional unsigned integer types of XX bits use this naming scheme (example: uint16 is a 16 bit wide unsigned integer). The current implementation supports <code>uint8</code>, <code>uint16</code>, <code>uint32</code>, <code>uint64</code>. Literals of these types have the suffix 'uXX. Unsigned operations all wrap around; they cannot lead to over- or underflow errors.</dd> </dl> <p>In addition to the usual arithmetic operators for signed and unsigned integers (<code>+ - *</code> etc.) there are also operators that formally work on <em>signed</em> integers but treat their arguments as <em>unsigned</em>: They are mostly provided for backwards compatibility with older versions of the language that lacked unsigned integer types. These unsigned operations for signed integers use the <code>%</code> suffix as convention:</p> <table>

<p><code>Subrange</code> is a subrange of an integer which can only hold the values 0 to 5. <code>PositiveFloat</code> defines a subrange of all positive floating point values. NaN does not belong to any subrange of floating point types. Assigning any other value to a variable of type <code>Subrange</code> is a checked runtime error (or static error if it can be statically determined). Assignments from the base type to one of its subrange types (and vice versa) are allowed.</p> <p>A subrange type has the same size as its base type (<code>int</code> in the Subrange example).</p> <h3 id="types-preminusdefined-floating-point-types">Pre-defined floating point types</h3>

<li>Invalid: operations with mathematically invalid operands, for example 0.0/0.0, sqrt(-1.0), and log(-37.8).</li> <li>Division by zero: divisor is zero and dividend is a finite nonzero number, for example 1.0/0.0.</li> <li>Overflow: operation produces a result that exceeds the range of the exponent, for example MAXDOUBLE+0.0000000000001e308.</li> <li>Underflow: operation produces a result that is too small to be represented as a normal number, for example, MINDOUBLE * MINDOUBLE.</li> <li>Inexact: operation produces a result that cannot be represented with infinite precision, for example, 2.0 / 3.0, log(1.1) and 0.1 in input.</li> </ul> <p>The IEEE exceptions are either ignored at runtime or mapped to the Nim exceptions: <span id="floatinvalidoperror_1">FloatInvalidOpError</span>, <span id="floatdivbyzeroerror_1">FloatDivByZeroError</span>, <span id="floatoverflowerror_1">FloatOverflowError</span>, <span id="floatunderflowerror_1">FloatUnderflowError</span>, and <span id="floatinexacterror_1">FloatInexactError</span>. These exceptions inherit from the <span id="floatingpointerror_1">FloatingPointError</span> base class.</p> <p>Nim provides the pragmas <span id="nanchecks_1">nanChecks</span> and <span id="infchecks_1">infChecks</span> to control whether the IEEE exceptions are ignored or trap a Nim exception:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">{.nanChecks: on, infChecks: on.}
var a = 1.0
var b = 0.0
echo b / b # raises FloatInvalidOpError
echo a / b # raises FloatOverflowError</pre>
<p>In the current implementation <code>FloatDivByZeroError</code> and <code>FloatInexactError</code> are never raised. <code>FloatOverflowError</code> is raised instead of <code>FloatDivByZeroError</code>. There is also a <span id="floatchecks_1">floatChecks</span> pragma that is a short-cut for the combination of <code>nanChecks</code> and <code>infChecks</code> pragmas. <code>floatChecks</code> are turned off as default.</p> <p>The only operations that are affected by the <code>floatChecks</code> pragma are the <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code> operators for floating point types.</p> <p>An implementation should always use the maximum precision available to evaluate floating pointer values at compile time; this means expressions like <code>0.09'f32 + 0.01'f32 == 0.09'f64 + 0.01'f64</code> are true.</p> <h3 id="types-boolean-type">Boolean type</h3>
<p>The boolean type is named <span id="bool_1">bool</span> in Nim and can be one of the two pre-defined values <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>. Conditions in <code>while</code>, <code>if</code>, <code>elif</code>, <code>when</code>-statements need to be of type <code>bool</code>.</p> <p>This condition holds:</p>
<pre data-language="nim">ord(false) == 0 and ord(true) == 1</pre> <p>The operators <code>not, and, or, xor, &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;=, !=, ==</code> are defined for the bool type. The <code>and</code> and <code>or</code> operators perform short-cut evaluation. Example:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">while p != nil and p.name != "xyz":
  # p.name is not evaluated if p == nil
  p = p.next</pre>
<p>The size of the bool type is one byte.</p> <h3 id="types-character-type">Character type</h3>
<p>The character type is named <code>char</code> in Nim. Its size is one byte. Thus it cannot represent an UTF-8 character, but a part of it. The reason for this is efficiency: for the overwhelming majority of use-cases, the resulting programs will still handle UTF-8 properly as UTF-8 was specially designed for this. Another reason is that Nim can support <code>array[char, int]</code> or <code>set[char]</code> efficiently as many algorithms rely on this feature. The <em>Rune</em> type is used for Unicode characters, it can represent any Unicode character. <code>Rune</code> is declared in the <a href="unicode">unicode module</a>.</p> <h3 id="types-enumeration-types">Enumeration types</h3>
<p>Enumeration types define a new type whose values consist of the ones specified. The values are ordered. Example:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">type
  Direction = enum
    north, east, south, west</pre>
<p>Now the following holds:</p>
<pre data-language="nim">ord(north) == 0
ord(east) == 1
ord(south) == 2
ord(west) == 3

# Also allowed:
ord(Direction.west) == 3</pre> <p>Thus, north &lt; east &lt; south &lt; west. The comparison operators can be used with enumeration types. Instead of <code>north</code> etc, the enum value can also be qualified with the enum type that it resides in, <code>Direction.north</code>.</p> <p>For better interfacing to other programming languages, the fields of enum types can be assigned an explicit ordinal value. However, the ordinal values have to be in ascending order. A field whose ordinal value is not explicitly given is assigned the value of the previous field + 1.</p> <p>An explicit ordered enum can have <em>holes</em>:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">type
  TokenType = enum
    a = 2, b = 4, c = 89 # holes are valid</pre>
<p>However, it is then not an ordinal anymore, so it is not possible to use these enums as an index type for arrays. The procedures <code>inc</code>, <code>dec</code>, <code>succ</code> and <code>pred</code> are not available for them either.</p> <p>The compiler supports the built-in stringify operator <code>$</code> for enumerations. The stringify's result can be controlled by explicitly giving the string values to use:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">type
  MyEnum = enum
    valueA = (0, "my value A"),
    valueB = "value B",
    valueC = 2,
    valueD = (3, "abc")</pre>
<p>As can be seen from the example, it is possible to both specify a field's ordinal value and its string value by using a tuple. It is also possible to only specify one of them.</p> <p>An enum can be marked with the <code>pure</code> pragma so that it's fields are added to a special module specific hidden scope that is only queried as the last attempt. Only non-ambiguous symbols are added to this scope. But one can always access these via type qualification written as <code>MyEnum.value</code>:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">type
  MyEnum {.pure.} = enum
    valueA, valueB, valueC, valueD, amb
  
  OtherEnum {.pure.} = enum
    valueX, valueY, valueZ, amb


echo valueA # MyEnum.valueA
echo amb    # Error: Unclear whether it's MyEnum.amb or OtherEnum.amb
echo MyEnum.amb # OK.</pre> <h3 id="types-string-type">String type</h3>
<p>All string literals are of the type <code>string</code>. A string in Nim is very similar to a sequence of characters. However, strings in Nim are both zero-terminated and have a length field. One can retrieve the length with the builtin <code>len</code> procedure; the length never counts the terminating zero.</p> <p>The terminating zero cannot be accessed unless the string is converted to the <code>cstring</code> type first. The terminating zero assures that this conversion can be done in O(1) and without any allocations.</p> <p>The assignment operator for strings always copies the string. The <code>&amp;</code> operator concatenates strings.</p> <p>Most native Nim types support conversion to strings with the special <code>$</code> proc. When calling the <code>echo</code> proc, for example, the built-in stringify operation for the parameter is called:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">echo 3 # calls `$` for `int`</pre>
<p>Whenever a user creates a specialized object, implementation of this procedure provides for <code>string</code> representation.</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">type
  Person = object
    name: string
    age: int

proc `$`(p: Person): string = # `$` always returns a string
  result = p.name &amp; " is " &amp;
          $p.age &amp; # we *need* the `$` in front of p.age which
                   # is natively an integer to convert it to
                   # a string
          " years old."</pre>
<p>While <code>$p.name</code> can also be used, the <code>$</code> operation on a string does nothing. Note that we cannot rely on automatic conversion from an <code>int</code> to a <code>string</code> like we can for the <code>echo</code> proc.</p> <p>Strings are compared by their lexicographical order. All comparison operators are available. Strings can be indexed like arrays (lower bound is 0). Unlike arrays, they can be used in case statements:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">case paramStr(i)
of "-v": incl(options, optVerbose)
of "-h", "-?": incl(options, optHelp)
else: write(stdout, "invalid command line option!\n")</pre>
<p>Per convention, all strings are UTF-8 strings, but this is not enforced. For example, when reading strings from binary files, they are merely a sequence of bytes. The index operation <code>s[i]</code> means the i-th <em>char</em> of <code>s</code>, not the i-th <em>unichar</em>. The iterator <code>runes</code> from the <a href="unicode">unicode module</a> can be used for iteration over all Unicode characters.</p> <h3 id="types-cstring-type">cstring type</h3>
<p>The <code>cstring</code> type meaning <em>compatible string</em> is the native representation of a string for the compilation backend. For the C backend the <code>cstring</code> type represents a pointer to a zero-terminated char array compatible to the type <code>char*</code> in Ansi C. Its primary purpose lies in easy interfacing with C. The index operation <code>s[i]</code> means the i-th <em>char</em> of <code>s</code>; however no bounds checking for <code>cstring</code> is performed making the index operation unsafe.</p> <p>A Nim <code>string</code> is implicitly convertible to <code>cstring</code> for convenience. If a Nim string is passed to a C-style variadic proc, it is implicitly converted to <code>cstring</code> too:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc printf(formatstr: cstring) {.importc: "printf", varargs,
                                  header: "&lt;stdio.h&gt;".}

printf("This works %s", "as expected")</pre>
<p>Even though the conversion is implicit, it is not <em>safe</em>: The garbage collector does not consider a <code>cstring</code> to be a root and may collect the underlying memory. However in practice this almost never happens as the GC considers stack roots conservatively. One can use the builtin procs <code>GC_ref</code> and <code>GC_unref</code> to keep the string data alive for the rare cases where it does not work.</p> <p>A <em>$</em> proc is defined for cstrings that returns a string. Thus to get a nim string from a cstring:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">var str: string = "Hello!"
var cstr: cstring = str
var newstr: string = $cstr</pre> <h3 id="types-structured-types">Structured types</h3>
<p>A variable of a structured type can hold multiple values at the same time. Structured types can be nested to unlimited levels. Arrays, sequences, tuples, objects and sets belong to the structured types.</p> <h3 id="types-array-and-sequence-types">Array and sequence types</h3>
<p>Arrays are a homogeneous type, meaning that each element in the array has the same type. Arrays always have a fixed length which is specified at compile time (except for open arrays). They can be indexed by any ordinal type. A parameter <code>A</code> may be an <em>open array</em>, in which case it is indexed by integers from 0 to <code>len(A)-1</code>. An array expression may be constructed by the array constructor <code>[]</code>. The element type of this array expression is inferred from the type of the first element. All other elements need to be implicitly convertable to this type.</p> <p>Sequences are similar to arrays but of dynamic length which may change during runtime (like strings). Sequences are implemented as growable arrays, allocating pieces of memory as items are added. A sequence <code>S</code> is always indexed by integers from 0 to <code>len(S)-1</code> and its bounds are checked. Sequences can be constructed by the array constructor <code>[]</code> in conjunction with the array to sequence operator <code>@</code>. Another way to allocate space for a sequence is to call the built-in <code>newSeq</code> procedure.</p> <p>A sequence may be passed to a parameter that is of type <em>open array</em>.</p> <p>Example:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">type
  IntArray = array[0..5, int] # an array that is indexed with 0..5
  IntSeq = seq[int] # a sequence of integers
var
  x: IntArray
  y: IntSeq
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  # [] is the array constructor
y = @[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] # the @ turns the array into a sequence

let z = [1.0, 2, 3, 4] # the type of z is array[0..3, float]</pre>
<p>The lower bound of an array or sequence may be received by the built-in proc <code>low()</code>, the higher bound by <code>high()</code>. The length may be received by <code>len()</code>. <code>low()</code> for a sequence or an open array always returns 0, as this is the first valid index. One can append elements to a sequence with the <code>add()</code> proc or the <code>&amp;</code> operator, and remove (and get) the last element of a sequence with the <code>pop()</code> proc.</p> <p>The notation <code>x[i]</code> can be used to access the i-th element of <code>x</code>.</p> <p>Arrays are always bounds checked (at compile-time or at runtime). These checks can be disabled via pragmas or invoking the compiler with the <code>--boundChecks:off</code> command line switch.</p> <h3 id="types-open-arrays">Open arrays</h3>
<p>Often fixed size arrays turn out to be too inflexible; procedures should be able to deal with arrays of different sizes. The <span id="openarray_1">openarray</span> type allows this; it can only be used for parameters. Openarrays are always indexed with an <code>int</code> starting at position 0. The <code>len</code>, <code>low</code> and <code>high</code> operations are available for open arrays too. Any array with a compatible base type can be passed to an openarray parameter, the index type does not matter. In addition to arrays sequences can also be passed to an open array parameter.</p> <p>The openarray type cannot be nested: multidimensional openarrays are not supported because this is seldom needed and cannot be done efficiently.</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc testOpenArray(x: openArray[int]) = echo repr(x)

testOpenArray([1,2,3])  # array[]
testOpenArray(@[1,2,3]) # seq[]</pre> <h3 id="types-varargs">Varargs</h3>
<p>A <code>varargs</code> parameter is an openarray parameter that additionally allows to pass a variable number of arguments to a procedure. The compiler converts the list of arguments to an array implicitly:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc myWriteln(f: File, a: varargs[string]) =
  for s in items(a):
    write(f, s)
  write(f, "\n")

myWriteln(stdout, "abc", "def", "xyz")
# is transformed to:
myWriteln(stdout, ["abc", "def", "xyz"])</pre>
<p>This transformation is only done if the varargs parameter is the last parameter in the procedure header. It is also possible to perform type conversions in this context:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc myWriteln(f: File, a: varargs[string, `$`]) =
  for s in items(a):
    write(f, s)
  write(f, "\n")

myWriteln(stdout, 123, "abc", 4.0)
# is transformed to:
myWriteln(stdout, [$123, $"def", $4.0])</pre>
<p>In this example <code>$</code> is applied to any argument that is passed to the parameter <code>a</code>. (Note that <code>$</code> applied to strings is a nop.)</p> <p>Note that an explicit array constructor passed to a <code>varargs</code> parameter is not wrapped in another implicit array construction:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc takeV[T](a: varargs[T]) = discard

takeV([123, 2, 1]) # takeV's T is "int", not "array of int"</pre>
<p><code>varargs[typed]</code> is treated specially: It matches a variable list of arguments of arbitrary type but <em>always</em> constructs an implicit array. This is required so that the builtin <code>echo</code> proc does what is expected:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc echo*(x: varargs[typed, `$`]) {...}

echo @[1, 2, 3]
# prints "@[1, 2, 3]" and not "123"</pre> <h3 id="types-tuples-and-object-types">Tuples and object types</h3>
<p>A variable of a tuple or object type is a heterogeneous storage container. A tuple or object defines various named <em>fields</em> of a type. A tuple also defines an <em>order</em> of the fields. Tuples are meant for heterogeneous storage types with no overhead and few abstraction possibilities. The constructor <code>()</code> can be used to construct tuples. The order of the fields in the constructor must match the order of the tuple's definition. Different tuple-types are <em>equivalent</em> if they specify the same fields of the same type in the same order. The <em>names</em> of the fields also have to be identical.</p> <p>The assignment operator for tuples copies each component. The default assignment operator for objects copies each component. Overloading of the assignment operator is described in <a href="#typeminusboundminusoperationsminusoperator">type-bound-operations-operator</a>.</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">type
  Person = tuple[name: string, age: int] # type representing a person:
                                         # a person consists of a name
                                         # and an age
var
  person: Person
person = (name: "Peter", age: 30)
# the same, but less readable:
person = ("Peter", 30)</pre>
<p>A tuple with one unnamed field can be constructed with the parentheses and a trailing comma:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc echoUnaryTuple(a: (int,)) =
  echo a[0]

echoUnaryTuple (1,)</pre>
<p>In fact, a trailing comma is allowed for every tuple construction.</p> <p>The implementation aligns the fields for best access performance. The alignment is compatible with the way the C compiler does it.</p> <p>For consistency with <code>object</code> declarations, tuples in a <code>type</code> section can also be defined with indentation instead of <code>[]</code>:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">type
  Person = tuple   # type representing a person
    name: string   # a person consists of a name
    age: natural   # and an age</pre>
<p>Objects provide many features that tuples do not. Object provide inheritance and information hiding. Objects have access to their type at runtime, so that the <code>of</code> operator can be used to determine the object's type. The <code>of</code> operator is similar to the <code>instanceof</code> operator in Java.</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">type
  Person = object of RootObj
    name*: string   # the * means that `name` is accessible from other modules
    age: int        # no * means that the field is hidden
  
  Student = ref object of Person # a student is a person
    id: int                      # with an id field

var
  student: Student
  person: Person
assert(student of Student) # is true
assert(student of Person) # also true</pre>
<p>Object fields that should be visible from outside the defining module, have to be marked by <code>*</code>. In contrast to tuples, different object types are never <em>equivalent</em>. Objects that have no ancestor are implicitly <code>final</code> and thus have no hidden type field. One can use the <code>inheritable</code> pragma to introduce new object roots apart from <code>system.RootObj</code>.</p> <h3 id="types-object-construction">Object construction</h3>
<p>Objects can also be created with an <span id="object-construction-expression_1">object construction expression</span> that has the syntax <code>T(fieldA: valueA, fieldB: valueB, ...)</code> where <code>T</code> is an <code>object</code> type or a <code>ref object</code> type:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">var student = Student(name: "Anton", age: 5, id: 3)</pre>
<p>Note that, unlike tuples, objects require the field names along with their values. For a <code>ref object</code> type <code>system.new</code> is invoked implicitly.</p> <h3 id="types-object-variants">Object variants</h3>
<p>Often an object hierarchy is overkill in certain situations where simple variant types are needed.</p> <p>An example:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim"># This is an example how an abstract syntax tree could be modelled in Nim
type
  NodeKind = enum  # the different node types
    nkInt,          # a leaf with an integer value
    nkFloat,        # a leaf with a float value
    nkString,       # a leaf with a string value
    nkAdd,          # an addition
    nkSub,          # a subtraction
    nkIf            # an if statement
  Node = ref NodeObj
  NodeObj = object
    case kind: NodeKind  # the ``kind`` field is the discriminator
    of nkInt: intVal: int
    of nkFloat: floatVal: float
    of nkString: strVal: string
    of nkAdd, nkSub:
      leftOp, rightOp: Node
    of nkIf:
      condition, thenPart, elsePart: Node

# create a new case object:
var n = Node(kind: nkIf, condition: nil)
# accessing n.thenPart is valid because the ``nkIf`` branch is active:
n.thenPart = Node(kind: nkFloat, floatVal: 2.0)

# the following statement raises an `FieldError` exception, because
# n.kind's value does not fit and the ``nkString`` branch is not active:
n.strVal = ""

# invalid: would change the active object branch:
n.kind = nkInt

var x = Node(kind: nkAdd, leftOp: Node(kind: nkInt, intVal: 4),
                          rightOp: Node(kind: nkInt, intVal: 2))
# valid: does not change the active object branch:
x.kind = nkSub</pre>
<p>As can been seen from the example, an advantage to an object hierarchy is that no casting between different object types is needed. Yet, access to invalid object fields raises an exception.</p> <p>The syntax of <code>case</code> in an object declaration follows closely the syntax of the <code>case</code> statement: The branches in a <code>case</code> section may be indented too.</p> <p>In the example the <code>kind</code> field is called the <span id="discriminator_1">discriminator</span>: For safety its address cannot be taken and assignments to it are restricted: The new value must not lead to a change of the active object branch. For an object branch switch <code>system.reset</code> has to be used. Also, when the fields of a particular branch are specified during object construction, the correct value for the discriminator must be supplied at compile-time.</p> <h3 id="types-package-level-objects">Package level objects</h3>
<p>Every Nim module resides in a (nimble) package. An object type can be attached to the package it resides in. If that is done, the type can be referenced from other modules as an <span id="incomplete_1">incomplete</span> object type. This features allows to break up recursive type dependencies accross module boundaries. Incomplete object types are always passed <code>byref</code> and can only be used in pointer like contexts (<code>var/ref/ptr IncompleteObject</code>) in general since the compiler does not yet know the size of the object. To complete an incomplete object the <code>package</code> pragma has to be used. <code>package</code> implies <code>byref</code>.</p> <p>As long as a type <code>T</code> is incomplete <code>sizeof(T)</code> or "runtime type information" for <code>T</code> is not available.</p> <p>Example:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim"># module A (in an arbitrary package)
type
  Pack.SomeObject = object ## declare as incomplete object of package 'Pack'
  Triple = object
    a, b, c: ref SomeObject ## pointers to incomplete objects are allowed

## Incomplete objects can be used as parameters:
proc myproc(x: SomeObject) = discard</pre>
<pre class="listing" data-language="nim"># module B (in package "Pack")
type
  SomeObject* {.package.} = object ## Use 'package' to complete the object
    s, t: string
    x, y: int</pre> <h3 id="types-set-type">Set type</h3>The set type models the mathematical notion of a set. The set's basetype can only be an ordinal type of a certain size, namely:<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>
<code>int8</code>-<code>int16</code>
</li> <li>
<code>uint8</code>/<code>byte</code>-<code>uint16</code>
</li> <li><code>char</code></li> <li><code>enum</code></li> </ul> </blockquote> <p>or equivalent. The reason is that sets are implemented as high performance bit vectors. Attempting to declare a set with a larger type will result in an error:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">var s: set[int64] # Error: set is too large</pre>
<p>Sets can be constructed via the set constructor: <code>{}</code> is the empty set. The empty set is type compatible with any concrete set type. The constructor can also be used to include elements (and ranges of elements):</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">type
  CharSet = set[char]
var
  x: CharSet
x = {'a'..'z', '0'..'9'} # This constructs a set that contains the

                         # from '0' to '9'</pre>
<p>These operations are supported by sets:</p> <table>

<p>Sets are often used to define a type for the <em>flags</em> of a procedure. This is a much cleaner (and type safe) solution than just defining integer constants that should be <code>or</code>'ed together. </p> <h3 id="types-reference-and-pointer-types">Reference and pointer types</h3>
<p>References (similar to pointers in other programming languages) are a way to introduce many-to-one relationships. This means different references can point to and modify the same location in memory (also called <span id="aliasing_1">aliasing</span>).</p> <p>Nim distinguishes between <span id="traced_1">traced</span> and <span id="untraced_1">untraced</span> references. Untraced references are also called <em>pointers</em>. Traced references point to objects of a garbage collected heap, untraced references point to manually allocated objects or to objects somewhere else in memory. Thus untraced references are <em>unsafe</em>. However for certain low-level operations (accessing the hardware) untraced references are unavoidable.</p> <p>Traced references are declared with the <strong>ref</strong> keyword, untraced references are declared with the <strong>ptr</strong> keyword. In general, a <em>ptr T</em> is implicitly convertible to the <em>pointer</em> type.</p> <p>An empty subscript <code>[]</code> notation can be used to derefer a reference, the <code>addr</code> procedure returns the address of an item. An address is always an untraced reference. Thus the usage of <code>addr</code> is an <em>unsafe</em> feature.</p> <p>The <code>.</code> (access a tuple/object field operator) and <code>[]</code> (array/string/sequence index operator) operators perform implicit dereferencing operations for reference types:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">type

<p>In order to simplify structural type checking, recursive tuples are not valid:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim"># invalid recursion

<p>Likewise <code>T = ref T</code> is an invalid type.</p> <p>As a syntactical extension <code>object</code> types can be anonymous if declared in a type section via the <code>ref object</code> or <code>ptr object</code> notations. This feature is useful if an object should only gain reference semantics:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">type

<p>To allocate a new traced object, the built-in procedure <code>new</code> has to be used. To deal with untraced memory, the procedures <code>alloc</code>, <code>dealloc</code> and <code>realloc</code> can be used. The documentation of the system module contains further information.</p> <p>If a reference points to <em>nothing</em>, it has the value <code>nil</code>.</p> <p>Special care has to be taken if an untraced object contains traced objects like traced references, strings or sequences: in order to free everything properly, the built-in procedure <code>GCunref</code> has to be called before freeing the untraced memory manually:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">type
  Data = tuple[x, y: int, s: string]

# allocate memory for Data on the heap:
var d = cast[ptr Data](alloc0(sizeof(Data)))

# create a new string on the garbage collected heap:
d.s = "abc"

# tell the GC that the string is not needed anymore:
GCunref(d.s)

# free the memory:
dealloc(d)</pre>
<p>Without the <code>GCunref</code> call the memory allocated for the <code>d.s</code> string would never be freed. The example also demonstrates two important features for low level programming: the <code>sizeof</code> proc returns the size of a type or value in bytes. The <code>cast</code> operator can circumvent the type system: the compiler is forced to treat the result of the <code>alloc0</code> call (which returns an untyped pointer) as if it would have the type <code>ptr Data</code>. Casting should only be done if it is unavoidable: it breaks type safety and bugs can lead to mysterious crashes.</p> <p><strong>Note</strong>: The example only works because the memory is initialized to zero (<code>alloc0</code> instead of <code>alloc</code> does this): <code>d.s</code> is thus initialized to binary zero which the string assignment can handle. One needs to know low level details like this when mixing garbage collected data with unmanaged memory.</p> <h3 id="types-not-nil-annotation">Not nil annotation</h3>
<p>All types for that <code>nil</code> is a valid value can be annotated to exclude <code>nil</code> as a valid value with the <code>not nil</code> annotation:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">type

<p>The compiler ensures that every code path initializes variables which contain non nilable pointers. The details of this analysis are still to be specified here.</p> <h3 id="types-procedural-type">Procedural type</h3>
<p>A procedural type is internally a pointer to a procedure. <code>nil</code> is an allowed value for variables of a procedural type. Nim uses procedural types to achieve <span id="functional_1">functional</span> programming techniques.</p> <p>Examples:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc printItem(x: int) = ...

# ok, 'onMouseMove' has the default calling convention, which is compatible

<p>A subtle issue with procedural types is that the calling convention of the procedure influences the type compatibility: procedural types are only compatible if they have the same calling convention. As a special extension, a procedure of the calling convention <code>nimcall</code> can be passed to a parameter that expects a proc of the calling convention <code>closure</code>.</p> <p>Nim supports these <span id="calling-conventions_1">calling conventions</span>:</p> <dl>

<p>A <code>distinct</code> type is new type derived from a <span id="base-type_1">base type</span> that is incompatible with its base type. In particular, it is an essential property of a distinct type that it <strong>does not</strong> imply a subtype relation between it and its base type. Explicit type conversions from a distinct type to its base type and vice versa are allowed. See also <code>distinctBase</code> to get the reverse operation.</p> <h4 id="distinct-type-modelling-currencies">Modelling currencies</h4>
<p>A distinct type can be used to model different physical <span id="units_1">units</span> with a numerical base type, for example. The following example models currencies.</p> <p>Different currencies should not be mixed in monetary calculations. Distinct types are a perfect tool to model different currencies:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">type
  Dollar = distinct int
  Euro = distinct int

var
  d: Dollar
  e: Euro

echo d + 12
# Error: cannot add a number with no unit and a ``Dollar``</pre>
<p>Unfortunately, <code>d + 12.Dollar</code> is not allowed either, because <code>+</code> is defined for <code>int</code> (among others), not for <code>Dollar</code>. So a <code>+</code> for dollars needs to be defined:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc `+` (x, y: Dollar): Dollar =
  result = Dollar(int(x) + int(y))</pre>
<p>It does not make sense to multiply a dollar with a dollar, but with a number without unit; and the same holds for division:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc `*` (x: Dollar, y: int): Dollar =
  result = Dollar(int(x) * y)

proc `*` (x: int, y: Dollar): Dollar =
  result = Dollar(x * int(y))

proc `div` ...</pre>
<p>This quickly gets tedious. The implementations are trivial and the compiler should not generate all this code only to optimize it away later - after all <code>+</code> for dollars should produce the same binary code as <code>+</code> for ints. The pragma <span id="borrow_1">borrow</span> has been designed to solve this problem; in principle it generates the above trivial implementations:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc `*` (x: Dollar, y: int): Dollar {.borrow.}
proc `*` (x: int, y: Dollar): Dollar {.borrow.}
proc `div` (x: Dollar, y: int): Dollar {.borrow.}</pre>
<p>The <code>borrow</code> pragma makes the compiler use the same implementation as the proc that deals with the distinct type's base type, so no code is generated.</p> <p>But it seems all this boilerplate code needs to be repeated for the <code>Euro</code> currency. This can be solved with <a href="#templates">templates</a>.</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">template additive(typ: type) =

<p>An SQL statement that is passed from Nim to an SQL database might be modelled as a string. However, using string templates and filling in the values is vulnerable to the famous <span id="sql-injection-attack_1">SQL injection attack</span>:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">import strutils

proc query(db: DbHandle, statement: string) = ...

var
  username: string

db.query("SELECT FROM users WHERE name = '$1'" % username)
# Horrible security hole, but the compiler does not mind!</pre>
<p>This can be avoided by distinguishing strings that contain SQL from strings that don't. Distinct types provide a means to introduce a new string type <code>SQL</code> that is incompatible with <code>string</code>:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">type
  SQL = distinct string

proc query(db: DbHandle, statement: SQL) = ...

var
  username: string

db.query("SELECT FROM users WHERE name = '$1'" % username)
# Error at compile time: `query` expects an SQL string!</pre>
<p>It is an essential property of abstract types that they <strong>do not</strong> imply a subtype relation between the abstract type and its base type. Explicit type conversions from <code>string</code> to <code>SQL</code> are allowed:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">import strutils, sequtils

  # we need a temporary type for the type conversion :-(
  type StrSeq = seq[string]
  # call strutils.`%`:
  result = SQL(string(frmt) % StrSeq(v))

db.query("SELECT FROM users WHERE name = '$1'".SQL % [username])</pre>
<p>Now we have compile-time checking against SQL injection attacks. Since <code>"".SQL</code> is transformed to <code>SQL("")</code> no new syntax is needed for nice looking <code>SQL</code> string literals.

<p>The <code>void</code> type denotes the absence of any type. Parameters of type <code>void</code> are treated as non-existent, <code>void</code> as a return type means that the procedure does not return a value:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc nothing(x, y: void): void =

callProc[int](intProc, 12)

<p>However, a <code>void</code> type cannot be inferred in generic code:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">callProc(emptyProc)
# Error: type mismatch: got (proc ())
# but expected one of:

<p>The <code>void</code> type is only valid for parameters and return types; other symbols cannot have the type <code>void</code>.</p> <h3 id="types-auto-type">Auto type</h3>
<p>The <code>auto</code> type can only be used for return types and parameters. For return types it causes the compiler to infer the type from the routine body:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc returnsInt(): auto = 1984</pre>
<p>For parameters it currently creates implicitly generic routines:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc foo(a, b: auto) = discard</pre>
<p>Is the same as:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc foo[T1, T2](a: T1, b: T2) = discard</pre>
<p>However later versions of the language might change this to mean "infer the parameters' types from the body". Then the above <code>foo</code> would be rejected as the parameters' types can not be inferred from an empty <code>discard</code> statement.</p> <h2 id="type-relations">Type relations</h2>

<li>Exact match: <code>a</code> and <code>f</code> are of the same type.</li> <li>Literal match: <code>a</code> is an integer literal of value <code>v</code> and <code>f</code> is a signed or unsigned integer type and <code>v</code> is in <code>f</code>'s range.

<p>If this algorithm returns "ambiguous" further disambiguation is performed: If the argument <code>a</code> matches both the parameter type <code>f</code> of <code>p</code> and <code>g</code> of <code>q</code> via a subtyping relation, the inheritance depth is taken into account:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">type

<p><strong>Note</strong>: The <code>.this</code> pragma is deprecated and should not be used anymore.</p> <p>Starting with version 0.14 of the language, Nim supports <code>field</code> as a shortcut for <code>self.field</code> comparable to the <span id="this_1">this</span> keyword in Java or C++. This feature has to be explicitly enabled via a <code>{.this: self.}</code> statement pragma. This pragma is active for the rest of the module:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">type

<p>Instead of <code>self</code> any other identifier can be used too, but <code>{.this: self.}</code> will become the default directive for the whole language eventually.</p> <p>In addition to fields, routine applications are also rewritten, but only if no other interpretation of the call is possible:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc test(self: Child) =

<p><strong>Note</strong>: An <span id="unresolved_1">unresolved</span> expression is an expression for which no symbol lookups and no type checking have been performed.</p> <p>Since templates and macros that are not declared as <code>immediate</code> participate in overloading resolution it's essential to have a way to pass unresolved expressions to a template or macro. This is what the meta-type <code>untyped</code> accomplishes:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">template rem(x: untyped) = discard

rem unresolvedExpression(undeclaredIdentifier)</pre>
<p>A parameter of type <code>untyped</code> always matches any argument (as long as there is any argument passed to it).</p> <p>But one has to watch out because other overloads might trigger the argument's resolution:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">template rem(x: untyped) = discard
proc rem[T](x: T) = discard

# undeclared identifier: 'unresolvedExpression'
rem unresolvedExpression(undeclaredIdentifier)</pre>
<p><code>untyped</code> and <code>varargs[untyped]</code> are the only metatype that are lazy in this sense, the other metatypes <code>typed</code> and <code>type</code> are not lazy.</p> <h3 id="overloading-resolution-varargs-matching">Varargs matching</h3>
<p>See <a href="#types-varargs">Varargs</a>.</p> <h2 id="statements-and-expressions">Statements and expressions</h2>
<p>Nim uses the common statement/expression paradigm: Statements do not produce a value in contrast to expressions. However, some expressions are statements.</p> <p>Statements are separated into <span id="simple-statements_1">simple statements</span> and <span id="complex-statements_1">complex statements</span>. Simple statements are statements that cannot contain other statements like assignments, calls or the <code>return</code> statement; complex statements can contain other statements. To avoid the <span id="dangling-else-problem_1">dangling else problem</span>, complex statements always have to be indented. The details can be found in the grammar.</p> <h3 id="statements-and-expressions-statement-list-expression">Statement list expression</h3>
<p>Statements can also occur in an expression context that looks like <code>(stmt1; stmt2; ...; ex)</code>. This is called an statement list expression or <code>(;)</code>. The type of <code>(stmt1; stmt2; ...; ex)</code> is the type of <code>ex</code>. All the other statements must be of type <code>void</code>. (One can use <code>discard</code> to produce a <code>void</code> type.) <code>(;)</code> does not introduce a new scope.</p> <h3 id="statements-and-expressions-discard-statement">Discard statement</h3>
<p>Example:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc p(x, y: int): int =
  result = x + y

discard p(3, 4) # discard the return value of `p`</pre>
<p>The <code>discard</code> statement evaluates its expression for side-effects and throws the expression's resulting value away.</p> <p>Ignoring the return value of a procedure without using a discard statement is a static error.</p> <p>The return value can be ignored implicitly if the called proc/iterator has been declared with the <span id="discardable_1">discardable</span> pragma:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc p(x, y: int): int {.discardable.} =
  result = x + y

p(3, 4) # now valid</pre>
<p>An empty <code>discard</code> statement is often used as a null statement:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc classify(s: string) =
  case s[0]
  of SymChars, '_': echo "an identifier"
  of '0'..'9': echo "a number"
  else: discard</pre> <h3 id="statements-and-expressions-void-context">Void context</h3>
<p>In a list of statements every expression except the last one needs to have the type <code>void</code>. In addition to this rule an assignment to the builtin <code>result</code> symbol also triggers a mandatory <code>void</code> context for the subsequent expressions:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc invalid*(): string =
  result = "foo"
  "invalid"  # Error: value of type 'string' has to be discarded</pre>
<pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc valid*(): string =
  let x = 317
  "valid"</pre> <h3 id="statements-and-expressions-var-statement">Var statement</h3>
<p>Var statements declare new local and global variables and initialize them. A comma separated list of variables can be used to specify variables of the same type:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">var
  a: int = 0
  x, y, z: int</pre>
<p>If an initializer is given the type can be omitted: the variable is then of the same type as the initializing expression. Variables are always initialized with a default value if there is no initializing expression. The default value depends on the type and is always a zero in binary.</p> <table>

<p>The implicit initialization can be avoided for optimization reasons with the <span id="noinit_1">noinit</span> pragma:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">var
  a {.noInit.}: array[0..1023, char]</pre>
<p>If a proc is annotated with the <code>noinit</code> pragma this refers to its implicit <code>result</code> variable:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc returnUndefinedValue: int {.noinit.} = discard</pre>
<p>The implicit initialization can be also prevented by the <span id="requiresinit_1">requiresInit</span> type pragma. The compiler requires an explicit initialization for the object and all of its fields. However it does a <span id="control-flow-analysis_1">control flow analysis</span> to prove the variable has been initialized and does not rely on syntactic properties:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">type
  MyObject = object {.requiresInit.}

proc p() =
  # the following is valid:
  var x: MyObject
  if someCondition():
    x = a()
  else:
    x = a()
  # use x</pre> <h3 id="statements-and-expressions-let-statement">let statement</h3>
<p>A <code>let</code> statement declares new local and global <span id="single-assignment_1">single assignment</span> variables and binds a value to them. The syntax is the same as that of the <code>var</code> statement, except that the keyword <code>var</code> is replaced by the keyword <code>let</code>. Let variables are not l-values and can thus not be passed to <code>var</code> parameters nor can their address be taken. They cannot be assigned new values.</p> <p>For let variables the same pragmas are available as for ordinary variables.</p> <h3 id="statements-and-expressions-tuple-unpacking">Tuple unpacking</h3>
<p>In a <code>var</code> or <code>let</code> statement tuple unpacking can be performed. The special identifier <code>_</code> can be used to ignore some parts of the tuple:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc returnsTuple(): (int, int, int) = (4, 2, 3)

let (x, _, z) = returnsTuple()</pre> <h3 id="statements-and-expressions-const-section">Const section</h3>
<p><span id="constants_1">Constants</span> are symbols which are bound to a value. The constant's value cannot change. The compiler must be able to evaluate the expression in a constant declaration at compile time.</p> <p>Nim contains a sophisticated compile-time evaluator, so procedures which have no side-effect can be used in constant expressions too:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">import strutils
const
  constEval = contains("abc", 'b') # computed at compile time!</pre>
<p>The rules for compile-time computability are:</p> <ol class="simple">
<li>Literals are compile-time computable.</li> <li>Type conversions are compile-time computable.</li> <li>Procedure calls of the form <code>p(X)</code> are compile-time computable if <code>p</code> is a proc without side-effects (see the <a href="#pragmas-nosideeffect-pragma">noSideEffect pragma</a> for details) and if <code>X</code> is a (possibly empty) list of compile-time computable arguments.</li> </ol> <p>Constants cannot be of type <code>ptr</code>, <code>ref</code> or <code>var</code>, nor can they contain such a type.</p> <h3 id="statements-and-expressions-static-statementslashexpression">Static statement/expression</h3>
<p>A static statement/expression can be used to enforce compile time evaluation explicitly. Enforced compile time evaluation can even evaluate code that has side effects:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">static:
  echo "echo at compile time"</pre>
<p>It's a static error if the compiler cannot perform the evaluation at compile time.</p> <p>The current implementation poses some restrictions for compile time evaluation: Code which contains <code>cast</code> or makes use of the foreign function interface cannot be evaluated at compile time. Later versions of Nim will support the FFI at compile time.</p> <h3 id="statements-and-expressions-if-statement">If statement</h3>
<p>Example:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">var name = readLine(stdin)

if name == "Andreas":
  echo "What a nice name!"
elif name == "":
  echo "Don't you have a name?"
else:
  echo "Boring name..."</pre>
<p>The <code>if</code> statement is a simple way to make a branch in the control flow: The expression after the keyword <code>if</code> is evaluated, if it is true the corresponding statements after the <code>:</code> are executed. Otherwise the expression after the <code>elif</code> is evaluated (if there is an <code>elif</code> branch), if it is true the corresponding statements after the <code>:</code> are executed. This goes on until the last <code>elif</code>. If all conditions fail, the <code>else</code> part is executed. If there is no <code>else</code> part, execution continues with the next statement.</p> <p>In <code>if</code> statements new scopes begin immediately after the <code>if</code>/<code>elif</code>/<code>else</code> keywords and ends after the corresponding <em>then</em> block. For visualization purposes the scopes have been enclosed in <code>{| |}</code> in the following example:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">if {| (let m = input =~ re"(\w+)=\w+"; m.isMatch):
  echo "key ", m[0], " value ", m[1]  |}
elif {| (let m = input =~ re""; m.isMatch):
  echo "new m in this scope"  |}
else: {|
  echo "m not declared here"  |}</pre> <h3 id="statements-and-expressions-case-statement">Case statement</h3>
<p>Example:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">case readline(stdin)
of "delete-everything", "restart-computer":
  echo "permission denied"
of "go-for-a-walk":     echo "please yourself"
else:                   echo "unknown command"

# indentation of the branches is also allowed; and so is an optional colon
# after the selecting expression:
case readline(stdin):
  of "delete-everything", "restart-computer":
    echo "permission denied"
  of "go-for-a-walk":     echo "please yourself"
  else:                   echo "unknown command"</pre>
<p>The <code>case</code> statement is similar to the if statement, but it represents a multi-branch selection. The expression after the keyword <code>case</code> is evaluated and if its value is in a <em>slicelist</em> the corresponding statements (after the <code>of</code> keyword) are executed. If the value is not in any given <em>slicelist</em> the <code>else</code> part is executed. If there is no <code>else</code> part and not all possible values that <code>expr</code> can hold occur in a <code>slicelist</code>, a static error occurs. This holds only for expressions of ordinal types. "All possible values" of <code>expr</code> are determined by <code>expr</code>'s type. To suppress the static error an <code>else</code> part with an empty <code>discard</code> statement should be used.</p> <p>For non ordinal types it is not possible to list every possible value and so these always require an <code>else</code> part.</p> <p>As case statements perform compile-time exhaustiveness checks, the value in every <code>of</code> branch must be known at compile time. This fact is also exploited to generate more performant code.</p> <p>As a special semantic extension, an expression in an <code>of</code> branch of a case statement may evaluate to a set or array constructor; the set or array is then expanded into a list of its elements:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">const
  SymChars: set[char] = {'a'..'z', 'A'..'Z', '\x80'..'\xFF'}

proc classify(s: string) =
  case s[0]

  else: echo "other"

# is equivalent to:
proc classify(s: string) =

elif sizeof(int) == 8:

else:
  echo "cannot happen!"</pre>
<p>The <code>when</code> statement is almost identical to the <code>if</code> statement with some exceptions:</p> <ul class="simple">
<li>Each condition (<code>expr</code>) has to be a constant expression (of type <code>bool</code>).</li> <li>The statements do not open a new scope.</li> <li>The statements that belong to the expression that evaluated to true are translated by the compiler, the other statements are not checked for semantics! However, each condition is checked for semantics.</li> </ul> <p>The <code>when</code> statement enables conditional compilation techniques. As a special syntactic extension, the <code>when</code> construct is also available within <code>object</code> definitions.</p> <h3 id="statements-and-expressions-when-nimvm-statement">When nimvm statement</h3>
<p><code>nimvm</code> is a special symbol, that may be used as expression of <code>when nimvm</code> statement to differentiate execution path between runtime and compile time.</p> <p>Example:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc someProcThatMayRunInCompileTime(): bool =
  when nimvm:
    # This code runs in compile time

    result = false
const ctValue = someProcThatMayRunInCompileTime()
let rtValue = someProcThatMayRunInCompileTime()
assert(ctValue == true)
assert(rtValue == false)</pre>
<p><code>when nimvm</code> statement must meet the following requirements:</p> <ul class="simple">
<li>Its expression must always be <code>nimvm</code>. More complex expressions are not allowed.</li> <li>It must not contain <code>elif</code> branches.</li> <li>It must contain <code>else</code> branch.</li> <li>Code in branches must not affect semantics of the code that follows the <code>when nimvm</code> statement. E.g. it must not define symbols that are used in the following code.</li> </ul> <h3 id="statements-and-expressions-return-statement">Return statement</h3>
<p>Example:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">return 40+2</pre>
<p>The <code>return</code> statement ends the execution of the current procedure. It is only allowed in procedures. If there is an <code>expr</code>, this is syntactic sugar for:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">result = expr
return result</pre>
<p><code>return</code> without an expression is a short notation for <code>return result</code> if the proc has a return type. The <span id="result_1">result</span> variable is always the return value of the procedure. It is automatically declared by the compiler. As all variables, <code>result</code> is initialized to (binary) zero:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc returnZero(): int =
  # implicitly returns 0</pre> <h3 id="statements-and-expressions-yield-statement">Yield statement</h3>
<p>Example:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">yield (1, 2, 3)</pre>
<p>The <code>yield</code> statement is used instead of the <code>return</code> statement in iterators. It is only valid in iterators. Execution is returned to the body of the for loop that called the iterator. Yield does not end the iteration process, but execution is passed back to the iterator if the next iteration starts. See the section about iterators (<a href="#iterators-and-the-for-statement">Iterators and the for statement</a>) for further information.</p> <h3 id="statements-and-expressions-block-statement">Block statement</h3>
<p>Example:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">var found = false
block myblock:
  for i in 0..3:
    for j in 0..3:
      if a[j][i] == 7:
        found = true
        break myblock # leave the block, in this case both for-loops
echo found</pre>
<p>The block statement is a means to group statements to a (named) <code>block</code>. Inside the block, the <code>break</code> statement is allowed to leave the block immediately. A <code>break</code> statement can contain a name of a surrounding block to specify which block is to leave.</p> <h3 id="statements-and-expressions-break-statement">Break statement</h3>
<p>Example:</p> <pre class="listing">break</pre>
<p>The <code>break</code> statement is used to leave a block immediately. If <code>symbol</code> is given, it is the name of the enclosing block that is to leave. If it is absent, the innermost block is left.</p> <h3 id="statements-and-expressions-while-statement">While statement</h3>
<p>Example:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">echo "Please tell me your password:"
var pw = readLine(stdin)
while pw != "12345":
  echo "Wrong password! Next try:"
  pw = readLine(stdin)</pre>
<p>The <code>while</code> statement is executed until the <code>expr</code> evaluates to false. Endless loops are no error. <code>while</code> statements open an <em>implicit block</em>, so that they can be left with a <code>break</code> statement.</p> <h3 id="statements-and-expressions-continue-statement">Continue statement</h3>
<p>A <code>continue</code> statement leads to the immediate next iteration of the surrounding loop construct. It is only allowed within a loop. A continue statement is syntactic sugar for a nested block:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">while expr1:

  stmt2</pre>

<p>An if expression always results in a value, so the <code>else</code> part is required. <code>Elif</code> parts are also allowed.</p> <h3 id="statements-and-expressions-when-expression">When expression</h3>
<p>Just like an <em>if expression</em>, but corresponding to the when statement.</p> <h3 id="statements-and-expressions-case-expression">Case expression</h3>
<p>The <em>case expression</em> is again very similar to the case statement:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">var favoriteFood = case animal
  of "dog": "bones"
  of "cat": "mice"
  elif animal.endsWith"whale": "plankton"
  else:
    echo "I'm not sure what to serve, but everybody loves ice cream"
    "ice cream"</pre>
<p>As seen in the above example, the case expression can also introduce side effects. When multiple statements are given for a branch, Nim will use the last expression as the result value, much like in an <em>expr</em> template.</p> <h3 id="statements-and-expressions-table-constructor">Table constructor</h3>
<p>A table constructor is syntactic sugar for an array constructor:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">{"key1": "value1", "key2", "key3": "value2"}

# is the same as:
[("key1", "value1"), ("key2", "value2"), ("key3", "value2")]</pre>
<p>The empty table can be written <code>{:}</code> (in contrast to the empty set which is <code>{}</code>) which is thus another way to write as the empty array constructor <code>[]</code>. This slightly unusual way of supporting tables has lots of advantages:</p> <ul class="simple">
<li>The order of the (key,value)-pairs is preserved, thus it is easy to support ordered dicts with for example <code>{key: val}.newOrderedTable</code>.</li> <li>A table literal can be put into a <code>const</code> section and the compiler can easily put it into the executable's data section just like it can for arrays and the generated data section requires a minimal amount of memory.</li> <li>Every table implementation is treated equal syntactically.</li> <li>Apart from the minimal syntactic sugar the language core does not need to know about tables.</li> </ul> <h3 id="statements-and-expressions-type-conversions">Type conversions</h3>
<p>Syntactically a <em>type conversion</em> is like a procedure call, but a type name replaces the procedure name. A type conversion is always safe in the sense that a failure to convert a type to another results in an exception (if it cannot be determined statically).</p> <p>Ordinary procs are often preferred over type conversions in Nim: For instance, <code>$</code> is the <code>toString</code> operator by convention and <code>toFloat</code> and <code>toInt</code> can be used to convert from floating point to integer or vice versa.</p> <h3 id="statements-and-expressions-type-casts">Type casts</h3>
<p>Example:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">cast[int](x)</pre>
<p>Type casts are a crude mechanism to interpret the bit pattern of an expression as if it would be of another type. Type casts are only needed for low-level programming and are inherently unsafe.</p> <h3 id="statements-and-expressions-the-addr-operator">The addr operator</h3>
<p>The <code>addr</code> operator returns the address of an l-value. If the type of the location is <code>T</code>, the <em>addr</em> operator result is of the type <code>ptr T</code>. An address is always an untraced reference. Taking the address of an object that resides on the stack is <strong>unsafe</strong>, as the pointer may live longer than the object on the stack and can thus reference a non-existing object. One can get the address of variables, but one can't use it on variables declared through <code>let</code> statements:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">let t1 = "Hello"
var
  t2 = t1
  t3 : pointer = addr(t2)
echo repr(addr(t2))
# --&gt; ref 0x7fff6b71b670 --&gt; 0x10bb81050"Hello"
echo cast[ptr string](t3)[]
# --&gt; Hello
# The following line doesn't compile:
echo repr(addr(t1))
# Error: expression has no address</pre> <h3 id="statements-and-expressions-the-unsafeaddr-operator">The unsafeAddr operator</h3>
<p>For easier interoperability with other compiled languages such as C, retrieving the address of a <code>let</code> variable, a parameter or a <code>for</code> loop variable, the <code>unsafeAddr</code> operation can be used:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">let myArray = [1, 2, 3]
foreignProcThatTakesAnAddr(unsafeAddr myArray)</pre> <h2 id="procedures">Procedures</h2>
<p>What most programming languages call <span id="methods_1">methods</span> or <span id="functions_1">functions</span> are called <span id="procedures_1">procedures</span> in Nim. A procedure declaration consists of an identifier, zero or more formal parameters, a return value type and a block of code. Formal parameters are declared as a list of identifiers separated by either comma or semicolon. A parameter is given a type by <code>: typename</code>. The type applies to all parameters immediately before it, until either the beginning of the parameter list, a semicolon separator or an already typed parameter, is reached. The semicolon can be used to make separation of types and subsequent identifiers more distinct.</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim"># Using only commas
proc foo(a, b: int, c, d: bool): int

# Using semicolon for visual distinction
proc foo(a, b: int; c, d: bool): int

# Will fail: a is untyped since ';' stops type propagation.
proc foo(a; b: int; c, d: bool): int</pre>
<p>A parameter may be declared with a default value which is used if the caller does not provide a value for the argument.</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim"># b is optional with 47 as its default value
proc foo(a: int, b: int = 47): int</pre>
<p>Parameters can be declared mutable and so allow the proc to modify those arguments, by using the type modifier <em>var</em>.</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim"># "returning" a value to the caller through the 2nd argument
# Notice that the function uses no actual return value at all (ie void)
proc foo(inp: int, outp: var int) =
  outp = inp + 47</pre>
<p>If the proc declaration has no body, it is a <span id="forward_1">forward</span> declaration. If the proc returns a value, the procedure body can access an implicitly declared variable named <span id="result_2">result</span> that represents the return value. Procs can be overloaded. The overloading resolution algorithm determines which proc is the best match for the arguments. Example:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc toLower(c: char): char = # toLower for characters
  if c in {'A'..'Z'}:
    result = chr(ord(c) + (ord('a') - ord('A')))
  else:
    result = c

proc toLower(s: string): string = # toLower for strings
  result = newString(len(s))
  for i in 0..len(s) - 1:
    result[i] = toLower(s[i]) # calls toLower for characters; no recursion!</pre>
<p>Calling a procedure can be done in many different ways:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc callme(x, y: int, s: string = "", c: char, b: bool = false) = ...

# call with positional arguments      # parameter bindings:
callme(0, 1, "abc", '\t', true)       # (x=0, y=1, s="abc", c='\t', b=true)
# call with named and positional arguments:
callme(y=1, x=0, "abd", '\t')         # (x=0, y=1, s="abd", c='\t', b=false)
# call with named arguments (order is not relevant):
callme(c='\t', y=1, x=0)              # (x=0, y=1, s="", c='\t', b=false)
# call as a command statement: no () needed:
callme 0, 1, "abc", '\t'              # (x=0, y=1, s="abc", c='\t', b=false)</pre>
<p>A procedure may call itself recursively.</p> <p><span id="operators_1">Operators</span> are procedures with a special operator symbol as identifier:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc `$` (x: int): string =
  # converts an integer to a string; this is a prefix operator.
  result = intToStr(x)</pre>
<p>Operators with one parameter are prefix operators, operators with two parameters are infix operators. (However, the parser distinguishes these from the operator's position within an expression.) There is no way to declare postfix operators: all postfix operators are built-in and handled by the grammar explicitly.</p> <p>Any operator can be called like an ordinary proc with the '<em>opr</em>' notation. (Thus an operator can have more than two parameters):</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc `*+` (a, b, c: int): int =
  # Multiply and add
  result = a * b + c

assert `*+`(3, 4, 6) == `+`(`*`(a, b), c)</pre> <h3 id="procedures-export-marker">Export marker</h3>
<p>If a declared symbol is marked with an <span id="asterisk_1">asterisk</span> it is exported from the current module:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc exportedEcho*(s: string) = echo s
proc `*`*(a: string; b: int): string =
  result = newStringOfCap(a.len * b)
  for i in 1..b: result.add a

var exportedVar*: int
const exportedConst* = 78
type
  ExportedType* = object
    exportedField*: int</pre> <h3 id="procedures-method-call-syntax">Method call syntax</h3>
<p>For object oriented programming, the syntax <code>obj.method(args)</code> can be used instead of <code>method(obj, args)</code>. The parentheses can be omitted if there are no remaining arguments: <code>obj.len</code> (instead of <code>len(obj)</code>).</p> <p>This method call syntax is not restricted to objects, it can be used to supply any type of first argument for procedures:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">echo "abc".len # is the same as echo len "abc"
echo "abc".toUpper()
echo {'a', 'b', 'c'}.card
stdout.writeLine("Hallo") # the same as writeLine(stdout, "Hallo")</pre>
<p>Another way to look at the method call syntax is that it provides the missing postfix notation.</p> <p>The method call syntax conflicts with explicit generic instantiations: <code>p[T](x)</code> cannot be written as <code>x.p[T]</code> because <code>x.p[T]</code> is always parsed as <code>(x.p)[T]</code>.</p> <p>See also: <a href="#templates-limitations-of-the-method-call-syntax">Limitations of the method call syntax</a>.</p> <p>The <code>[: ]</code> notation has been designed to mitigate this issue: <code>x.p[:T]</code> is rewritten by the parser to <code>p[T](x)</code>, <code>x.p[:T](y)</code> is rewritten to <code>p[T](x, y)</code>. Note that <code>[: ]</code> has no AST representation, the rewrite is performed directly in the parsing step.</p> <h3 id="procedures-properties">Properties</h3>
<p>Nim has no need for <em>get-properties</em>: Ordinary get-procedures that are called with the <em>method call syntax</em> achieve the same. But setting a value is different; for this a special setter syntax is needed:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim"># Module asocket
type
  Socket* = ref object of RootObj
    host: int # cannot be accessed from the outside of the module

proc `host=`*(s: var Socket, value: int) {.inline.} =
  ## setter of hostAddr.
  ## This accesses the 'host' field and is not a recursive call to
  ## ``host=`` because the builtin dot access is preferred if it is
  ## avaliable:
  s.host = value

proc host*(s: Socket): int {.inline.} =
  ## getter of hostAddr
  ## This accesses the 'host' field and is not a recursive call to
  ## ``host`` because the builtin dot access is preferred if it is
  ## avaliable:
  s.host</pre>
<pre class="listing" data-language="nim"># module B
import asocket
var s: Socket
new s
s.host = 34  # same as `host=`(s, 34)</pre> <h3 id="procedures-command-invocation-syntax">Command invocation syntax</h3>
<p>Routines can be invoked without the <code>()</code> if the call is syntactically a statement. This command invocation syntax also works for expressions, but then only a single argument may follow. This restriction means <code>echo f 1, f 2</code> is parsed as <code>echo(f(1), f(2))</code> and not as <code>echo(f(1, f(2)))</code>. The method call syntax may be used to provide one more argument in this case:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc optarg(x: int, y: int = 0): int = x + y
proc singlearg(x: int): int = 20*x

echo optarg 1, " ", singlearg 2  # prints "1 40"

let fail = optarg 1, optarg 8   # Wrong. Too many arguments for a command call
let x = optarg(1, optarg 8)  # traditional procedure call with 2 arguments
let y = 1.optarg optarg 8    # same thing as above, w/o the parenthesis
assert x == y</pre>
<p>The command invocation syntax also can't have complex expressions as arguments. For example: (<a href="#anonymous-procs">anonymous procs</a>), <code>if</code>, <code>case</code> or <code>try</code>. The (<a href="#do-notation">do notation</a>) is limited, but usable for a single proc (see the example in the corresponding section). Function calls with no arguments still needs () to distinguish between a call and the function itself as a first class value.</p> <h3 id="procedures-closures">Closures</h3>
<p>Procedures can appear at the top level in a module as well as inside other scopes, in which case they are called nested procs. A nested proc can access local variables from its enclosing scope and if it does so it becomes a closure. Any captured variables are stored in a hidden additional argument to the closure (its environment) and they are accessed by reference by both the closure and its enclosing scope (i.e. any modifications made to them are visible in both places). The closure environment may be allocated on the heap or on the stack if the compiler determines that this would be safe.</p> <h4 id="closures-creating-closures-in-loops">Creating closures in loops</h4>
<p>Since closures capture local variables by reference it is often not wanted behavior inside loop bodies. See <a href="system#closureScope">closureScope</a> for details on how to change this behavior.</p> <h3 id="procedures-anonymous-procs">Anonymous Procs</h3>
<p>Procs can also be treated as expressions, in which case it's allowed to omit the proc's name.</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">var cities = @["Frankfurt", "Tokyo", "New York", "Kyiv"]

cities.sort(proc (x,y: string): int =
    cmp(x.len, y.len))</pre>
<p>Procs as expressions can appear both as nested procs and inside top level executable code.</p> <h3 id="procedures-func">Func</h3>
<p>The <code>func</code> keyword introduces a shortcut for a <span id="nosideeffect_1">noSideEffect</span> proc.</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">func binarySearch[T](a: openArray[T]; elem: T): int</pre>
<p>Is short for:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc binarySearch[T](a: openArray[T]; elem: T): int {.noSideEffect.}</pre> <h3 id="procedures-do-notation">Do notation</h3>
<p>As a special more convenient notation, proc expressions involved in procedure calls can use the <code>do</code> keyword:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">sort(cities) do (x,y: string) -&gt; int:
  cmp(x.len, y.len)

# Less parenthesis using the method plus command syntax:
cities = cities.map do (x:string) -&gt; string:
  "City of " &amp; x

# In macros, the do notation is often used for quasi-quoting
macroResults.add quote do:
  if not `ex`:
    echo `info`, ": Check failed: ", `expString`</pre>
<p><code>do</code> is written after the parentheses enclosing the regular proc params. The proc expression represented by the do block is appended to them. In calls using the command syntax, the do block will bind to the immediately preceeding expression, transforming it in a call.</p> <p><code>do</code> with parentheses is an anonymous <code>proc</code>; however a <code>do</code> without parentheses is just a block of code. The <code>do</code> notation can be used to pass multiple blocks to a macro:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">macro performWithUndo(task, undo: untyped) = ...

performWithUndo do:
  # multiple-line block of code
  # to perform the task
do:
  # code to undo it</pre> <h3 id="procedures-nonoverloadable-builtins">Nonoverloadable builtins</h3>
<p>The following builtin procs cannot be overloaded for reasons of implementation simplicity (they require specialized semantic checking):</p>
<pre data-language="nim">declared, defined, definedInScope, compiles, sizeOf,
is, shallowCopy, getAst, astToStr, spawn, procCall</pre> <p>Thus they act more like keywords than like ordinary identifiers; unlike a keyword however, a redefinition may <span id="shadow_1">shadow</span> the definition in the <code>system</code> module. From this list the following should not be written in dot notation <code>x.f</code> since <code>x</code> cannot be type checked before it gets passed to <code>f</code>:</p>
<pre data-language="nim">declared, defined, definedInScope, compiles, getAst, astToStr</pre> <h3 id="procedures-var-parameters">Var parameters</h3>
<p>The type of a parameter may be prefixed with the <code>var</code> keyword:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc divmod(a, b: int; res, remainder: var int) =
  res = a div b
  remainder = a mod b

var
  x, y: int

divmod(8, 5, x, y) # modifies x and y
assert x == 1
assert y == 3</pre>
<p>In the example, <code>res</code> and <code>remainder</code> are <em>var parameters</em>. Var parameters can be modified by the procedure and the changes are visible to the caller. The argument passed to a var parameter has to be an l-value. Var parameters are implemented as hidden pointers. The above example is equivalent to:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc divmod(a, b: int; res, remainder: ptr int) =
  res[] = a div b
  remainder[] = a mod b

var
  x, y: int
divmod(8, 5, addr(x), addr(y))
assert x == 1
assert y == 3</pre>
<p>In the examples, var parameters or pointers are used to provide two return values. This can be done in a cleaner way by returning a tuple:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc divmod(a, b: int): tuple[res, remainder: int] =
  (a div b, a mod b)

var t = divmod(8, 5)

assert t.res == 1
assert t.remainder == 3</pre>
<p>One can use <span id="tuple-unpacking_1">tuple unpacking</span> to access the tuple's fields:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">var (x, y) = divmod(8, 5) # tuple unpacking
assert x == 1
assert y == 3</pre>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: <code>var</code> parameters are never necessary for efficient parameter passing. Since non-var parameters cannot be modified the compiler is always free to pass arguments by reference if it considers it can speed up execution.</p> <h3 id="procedures-var-return-type">Var return type</h3>
<p>A proc, converter or iterator may return a <code>var</code> type which means that the returned value is an l-value and can be modified by the caller:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">var g = 0

proc writeAccessToG(): var int =
  result = g

writeAccessToG() = 6
assert g == 6</pre>
<p>It is a compile time error if the implicitly introduced pointer could be used to access a location beyond its lifetime:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc writeAccessToG(): var int =
  var g = 0
  result = g # Error!</pre>
<p>For iterators, a component of a tuple return type can have a <code>var</code> type too:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">iterator mpairs(a: var seq[string]): tuple[key: int, val: var string] =
  for i in 0..a.high:
    yield (i, a[i])</pre>
<p>In the standard library every name of a routine that returns a <code>var</code> type starts with the prefix <code>m</code> per convention.</p> Memory safety for returning by <code>var T</code> is ensured by a simple borrowing rule: If <code>result</code> does not refer to a location pointing to the heap (that is in <code>result = X</code> the <code>X</code> involves a <code>ptr</code> or <code>ref</code> access) then it has to be deviated by the routine's first parameter:<pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc forward[T](x: var T): var T =
  result = x # ok, deviated from the first parameter.

proc p(param: var int): var int =
  var x: int
  # we know 'forward' provides a view into the location deviated by
  # its first argument 'x'.
  result = forward(x) # Error: location is derived from ``x``
                      # which is not p's first parameter and lives
                      # on the stack.</pre>
<p>In other words, the lifetime of what <code>result</code> points to is attached to the lifetime of the first parameter and that is enough knowledge to verify memory safety at the callsite. </p> <h4 id="var-return-type-future-directions">Future directions</h4>
<p>Later versions of Nim can be more precise about the borrowing rule with a syntax like:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc foo(other: Y; container: var X): var T from container</pre>
<p>Here <code>var T from container</code> explicitly exposes that the location is deviated from the second parameter (called 'container' in this case). The syntax <code>var T from p</code> specifies a type <code>varTy[T, 2]</code> which is incompatible with <code>varTy[T, 1]</code>.</p> <h3 id="procedures-overloading-of-the-subscript-operator">Overloading of the subscript operator</h3>
<p>The <code>[]</code> subscript operator for arrays/openarrays/sequences can be overloaded.</p> <h2 id="multiminusmethods">Multi-methods</h2>

<p>The <span id="for_1">for</span> statement is an abstract mechanism to iterate over the elements of a container. It relies on an <span id="iterator_1">iterator</span> to do so. Like <code>while</code> statements, <code>for</code> statements open an <span id="implicit-block_1">implicit block</span>, so that they can be left with a <code>break</code> statement.</p> <p>The <code>for</code> loop declares iteration variables - their scope reaches until the end of the loop body. The iteration variables' types are inferred by the return type of the iterator.</p> <p>An iterator is similar to a procedure, except that it can be called in the context of a <code>for</code> loop. Iterators provide a way to specify the iteration over an abstract type. A key role in the execution of a <code>for</code> loop plays the <code>yield</code> statement in the called iterator. Whenever a <code>yield</code> statement is reached the data is bound to the <code>for</code> loop variables and control continues in the body of the <code>for</code> loop. The iterator's local variables and execution state are automatically saved between calls. Example:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim"># this definition exists in the system module
iterator items*(a: string): char {.inline.} =
  var i = 0
  while i &lt; len(a):
    yield a[i]

for ch in items("hello world"): # `ch` is an iteration variable
  echo ch</pre>
<p>The compiler generates code as if the programmer would have written this:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">var i = 0
while i &lt; len(a):
  var ch = a[i]
  echo ch
  inc(i)</pre>
<p>If the iterator yields a tuple, there can be as many iteration variables as there are components in the tuple. The i'th iteration variable's type is the type of the i'th component. In other words, implicit tuple unpacking in a for loop context is supported.</p> <h3 id="iterators-and-the-for-statement-implict-itemsslashpairs-invocations">Implict items/pairs invocations</h3>
<p>If the for loop expression <code>e</code> does not denote an iterator and the for loop has exactly 1 variable, the for loop expression is rewritten to <code>items(e)</code>; ie. an <code>items</code> iterator is implicitly invoked:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">for x in [1,2,3]: echo x</pre>
<p>If the for loop has exactly 2 variables, a <code>pairs</code> iterator is implicitly invoked.</p> <p>Symbol lookup of the identifiers <code>items</code>/<code>pairs</code> is performed after the rewriting step, so that all overloads of <code>items</code>/<code>pairs</code> are taken into account.</p> <h3 id="iterators-and-the-for-statement-first-class-iterators">First class iterators</h3>
<p>There are 2 kinds of iterators in Nim: <em>inline</em> and <em>closure</em> iterators. An <span id="inline-iterator_1">inline iterator</span> is an iterator that's always inlined by the compiler leading to zero overhead for the abstraction, but may result in a heavy increase in code size.

<p>Closure iterators have other restrictions than inline iterators:</p> <ol class="simple">
<li>
<code>yield</code> in a closure iterator can not occur in a <code>try</code> statement.</li> <li>For now, a closure iterator cannot be evaluated at compile time.</li> <li>
<code>return</code> is allowed in a closure iterator (but rarely useful) and ends iteration.</li> <li>Neither inline nor closure iterators can be recursive.</li> <li>Closure iterators are not supported by the js backend.</li> </ol> <p>Iterators that are neither marked <code>{.closure.}</code> nor <code>{.inline.}</code> explicitly default to being inline, but this may change in future versions of the implementation.</p> <p>The <code>iterator</code> type is always of the calling convention <code>closure</code> implicitly; the following example shows how to use iterators to implement a <span id="collaborative-tasking_1">collaborative tasking</span> system:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim"># simple tasking:
type
  Task = iterator (ticker: int)

iterator a1(ticker: int) {.closure.} =
  echo "a1: A"
  yield
  echo "a1: B"
  yield
  echo "a1: C"
  yield
  echo "a1: D"

iterator a2(ticker: int) {.closure.} =

    let x = t[ticker mod t.len]
    if finished(x): break
    x(ticker)
    inc ticker

runTasks(a1, a2)</pre>
<p>The builtin <code>system.finished</code> can be used to determine if an iterator has finished its operation; no exception is raised on an attempt to invoke an iterator that has already finished its work.</p> <p>Note that <code>system.finished</code> is error prone to use because it only returns <code>true</code> one iteration after the iterator has finished:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">iterator mycount(a, b: int): int {.closure.} =
  var x = a
  while x &lt;= b:
    yield x
    inc x

var c = mycount # instantiate the iterator
while not finished(c):
  echo c(1, 3)

# Produces
1
2
3
0</pre>
<p>Instead this code has to be used:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">var c = mycount # instantiate the iterator
while true:
  let value = c(1, 3)
  if finished(c): break # and discard 'value'!
  echo value</pre>
<p>It helps to think that the iterator actually returns a pair <code>(value, done)</code> and <code>finished</code> is used to access the hidden <code>done</code> field.</p> <p>Closure iterators are <em>resumable functions</em> and so one has to provide the arguments to every call. To get around this limitation one can capture parameters of an outer factory proc:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc mycount(a, b: int): iterator (): int =
  result = iterator (): int =
    var x = a
    while x &lt;= b:
      yield x
      inc x

let foo = mycount(1, 4)

for f in foo():
  echo f</pre> <h2 id="converters">Converters</h2>
<p>A converter is like an ordinary proc except that it enhances the "implicitly convertible" type relation (see <a href="#type-relations-convertible-relation">Convertible relation</a>):</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim"># bad style ahead: Nim is not C.
converter toBool(x: int): bool = x != 0

if 4:
  echo "compiles"</pre>
<p>A converter can also be explicitly invoked for improved readability. Note that implicit converter chaining is not supported: If there is a converter from type A to type B and from type B to type C the implicit conversion from A to C is not provided.</p> <h2 id="type-sections">Type sections</h2>
<p>Example:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">type # example demonstrating mutually recursive types
  Node = ref object  # an object managed by the garbage collector (ref)
    le, ri: Node     # left and right subtrees
    sym: ref Sym     # leaves contain a reference to a Sym
  
  Sym = object       # a symbol
    name: string     # the symbol's name
    line: int        # the line the symbol was declared in
    code: Node       # the symbol's abstract syntax tree</pre>
<p>A type section begins with the <code>type</code> keyword. It contains multiple type definitions. A type definition binds a type to a name. Type definitions can be recursive or even mutually recursive. Mutually recursive types are only possible within a single <code>type</code> section. Nominal types like <code>objects</code> or <code>enums</code> can only be defined in a <code>type</code> section.</p> <h2 id="exception-handling">Exception handling</h2> <h3 id="exception-handling-try-statement">Try statement</h3>
<p>Example:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim"># read the first two lines of a text file that should contain numbers

    echo "Unknown exception!"
  finally:
    close(f)</pre>
<p>The statements after the <code>try</code> are executed in sequential order unless an exception <code>e</code> is raised. If the exception type of <code>e</code> matches any listed in an <code>except</code> clause the corresponding statements are executed. The statements following the <code>except</code> clauses are called <span id="exception-handlers_1">exception handlers</span>.</p> <p>The empty <span id="except_1">except</span> clause is executed if there is an exception that is not listed otherwise. It is similar to an <code>else</code> clause in <code>if</code> statements.</p> <p>If there is a <span id="finally_1">finally</span> clause, it is always executed after the exception handlers.</p> <p>The exception is <em>consumed</em> in an exception handler. However, an exception handler may raise another exception. If the exception is not handled, it is propagated through the call stack. This means that often the rest of the procedure - that is not within a <code>finally</code> clause - is not executed (if an exception occurs).</p> <h3 id="exception-handling-try-expression">Try expression</h3>
<p>Try can also be used as an expression; the type of the <code>try</code> branch then needs to fit the types of <code>except</code> branches, but the type of the <code>finally</code> branch always has to be <code>void</code>:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">let x = try: parseInt("133a")
        except: -1
        finally: echo "hi"</pre>
<p>To prevent confusing code there is a parsing limitation; if the <code>try</code> follows a <code>(</code> it has to be written as a one liner:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">let x = (try: parseInt("133a") except: -1)</pre> <h3 id="exception-handling-except-clauses">Except clauses</h3>
<p>Within an <code>except</code> clause, it is possible to use <code>getCurrentException</code> to retrieve the exception that has been raised:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">try:
  # ...
except IOError:
  let e = getCurrentException()
  # Now use "e"</pre>
<p>Note that <code>getCurrentException</code> always returns a <code>ref Exception</code> type. If a variable of the proper type is needed (in the example above, <code>IOError</code>), one must convert it explicitly:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">try:
  # ...
except IOError:
  let e = (ref IOError)(getCurrentException())
  # "e" is now of the proper type</pre>
<p>However, this is seldom needed. The most common case is to extract an error message from <code>e</code>, and for such situations it is enough to use <code>getCurrentExceptionMsg</code>:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">try:
  # ...
except IOError:
  echo "I/O error: " &amp; getCurrentExceptionMsg()</pre> <h3 id="exception-handling-defer-statement">Defer statement</h3>
<p>Instead of a <code>try finally</code> statement a <code>defer</code> statement can be used.</p> <p>Any statements following the <code>defer</code> in the current block will be considered to be in an implicit try block:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc main =
  var f = open("numbers.txt")
  defer: close(f)
  f.write "abc"
  f.write "def"</pre>
<p>Is rewritten to:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc main =
  var f = open("numbers.txt")
  try:
    f.write "abc"
    f.write "def"
  finally:
    close(f)</pre>
<p>Top level <code>defer</code> statements are not supported since it's unclear what such a statement should refer to.</p> <h3 id="exception-handling-raise-statement">Raise statement</h3>
<p>Example:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">raise newEOS("operating system failed")</pre>
<p>Apart from built-in operations like array indexing, memory allocation, etc. the <code>raise</code> statement is the only way to raise an exception.</p> <p>If no exception name is given, the current exception is <span id="reminusraised_1">re-raised</span>. The <span id="reraiseerror_1">ReraiseError</span> exception is raised if there is no exception to re-raise. It follows that the <code>raise</code> statement <em>always</em> raises an exception.</p> <h3 id="exception-handling-exception-hierarchy">Exception hierarchy</h3>
<p>The exception tree is defined in the <a href="system">system</a> module. Every exception inherits from <code>system.Exception</code>. Exceptions that indicate programming bugs inherit from <code>system.Defect</code> (which is a subtype of <code>Exception</code>) and are stricly speaking not catchable as they can also be mapped to an operation that terminates the whole process. Exceptions that indicate any other runtime error that can be caught inherit from <code>system.CatchableError</code> (which is a subtype of <code>Exception</code>).</p> <h3 id="exception-handling-imported-exceptions">Imported exceptions</h3>
<p>It is possible to raise/catch imported C++ exceptions. Types imported using <em>importcpp</em> can be raised or caught. Exceptions are raised by value and caught by reference. Example:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">type
  std_exception {.importcpp: "std::exception", header: "&lt;exception&gt;".} = object

proc what(s: std_exception): cstring {.importcpp: "((char *)#.what())".}

try:
  raise std_exception()
except std_exception as ex:
  echo ex.what()</pre> <h2 id="effect-system">Effect system</h2> <h3 id="effect-system-exception-tracking">Exception tracking</h3>
<p>Nim supports exception tracking. The <span id="raises_1">raises</span> pragma can be used to explicitly define which exceptions a proc/iterator/method/converter is allowed to raise. The compiler verifies this:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc p(what: bool) {.raises: [IOError, OSError].} =
  if what: raise newException(IOError, "IO")
  else: raise newException(OSError, "OS")</pre>
<p>An empty <code>raises</code> list (<code>raises: []</code>) means that no exception may be raised:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc p(): bool {.raises: [].} =
  try:
    unsafeCall()
    result = true
  except:
    result = false</pre>
<p>A <code>raises</code> list can also be attached to a proc type. This affects type compatibility:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">type
  Callback = proc (s: string) {.raises: [IOError].}
var
  c: Callback

proc p(x: string) =
  raise newException(OSError, "OS")

c = p # type error</pre>
<p>For a routine <code>p</code> the compiler uses inference rules to determine the set of possibly raised exceptions; the algorithm operates on <code>p</code>'s call graph:</p> <ol class="simple">
<li>Every indirect call via some proc type <code>T</code> is assumed to raise <code>system.Exception</code> (the base type of the exception hierarchy) and thus any exception unless <code>T</code> has an explicit <code>raises</code> list. However if the call is of the form <code>f(...)</code> where <code>f</code> is a parameter of the currently analysed routine it is ignored. The call is optimistically assumed to have no effect. Rule 2 compensates for this case.</li> <li>Every expression of some proc type within a call that is not a call itself (and not nil) is assumed to be called indirectly somehow and thus its raises list is added to <code>p</code>'s raises list.</li> <li>Every call to a proc <code>q</code> which has an unknown body (due to a forward declaration or an <code>importc</code> pragma) is assumed to raise <code>system.Exception</code> unless <code>q</code> has an explicit <code>raises</code> list.</li> <li>Every call to a method <code>m</code> is assumed to raise <code>system.Exception</code> unless <code>m</code> has an explicit <code>raises</code> list.</li> <li>For every other call the analysis can determine an exact <code>raises</code> list.</li> <li>For determining a <code>raises</code> list, the <code>raise</code> and <code>try</code> statements of <code>p</code> are taken into consideration.</li> </ol> <p>Rules 1-2 ensure the following works:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc noRaise(x: proc()) {.raises: [].} =
  # unknown call that might raise anything, but valid:
  x()

proc doRaise() {.raises: [IOError].} =
  raise newException(IOError, "IO")

proc use() {.raises: [].} =
  # doesn't compile! Can raise IOError!
  noRaise(doRaise)</pre>
<p>So in many cases a callback does not cause the compiler to be overly conservative in its effect analysis.</p> <h3 id="effect-system-tag-tracking">Tag tracking</h3>
<p>The exception tracking is part of Nim's <span id="effect-system_1">effect system</span>. Raising an exception is an <em>effect</em>. Other effects can also be defined. A user defined effect is a means to <em>tag</em> a routine and to perform checks against this tag:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">type IO = object ## input/output effect
proc readLine(): string {.tags: [IO].} = discard

proc no_IO_please() {.tags: [].} =
  # the compiler prevents this:
  let x = readLine()</pre>
<p>A tag has to be a type name. A <code>tags</code> list - like a <code>raises</code> list - can also be attached to a proc type. This affects type compatibility.</p> <p>The inference for tag tracking is analogous to the inference for exception tracking.</p> <h3 id="effect-system-readslashwrite-tracking">Read/Write tracking</h3>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Read/write tracking is not yet implemented!</p> <p>The inference for read/write tracking is analogous to the inference for exception tracking.</p> <h3 id="effect-system-effects-pragma">Effects pragma</h3>
<p>The <code>effects</code> pragma has been designed to assist the programmer with the effects analysis. It is a statement that makes the compiler output all inferred effects up to the <code>effects</code>'s position:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc p(what: bool) =
  if what:
    raise newException(IOError, "IO")
    {.effects.}
  else:
    raise newException(OSError, "OS")</pre>
<p>The compiler produces a hint message that <code>IOError</code> can be raised. <code>OSError</code> is not listed as it cannot be raised in the branch the <code>effects</code> pragma appears in.</p> <h2 id="generics">Generics</h2>
<p>Generics are Nim's means to parametrize procs, iterators or types with <span id="type-parameters_1">type parameters</span>. Depending on context, the brackets are used either to introduce type parameters or to instantiate a generic proc, iterator or type.</p> <p>The following example shows a generic binary tree can be modelled:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">type
  BinaryTree*[T] = ref object # BinaryTree is a generic type with
                              # generic param ``T``
    le, ri: BinaryTree[T]     # left and right subtrees; may be nil
    data: T                   # the data stored in a node

proc newNode*[T](data: T): BinaryTree[T] =
  # constructor for a node
  result = BinaryTree[T](le: nil, ri: nil, data: data)

proc add*[T](root: var BinaryTree[T], n: BinaryTree[T]) =
  # insert a node into the tree
  if root == nil:
    root = n
  else:
    var it = root
    while it != nil:
      # compare the data items; uses the generic ``cmp`` proc
      # that works for any type that has a ``==`` and ``&lt;`` operator
      var c = cmp(it.data, n.data)
      if c &lt; 0:
        if it.le == nil:
          it.le = n
          return
        it = it.le
      else:
        if it.ri == nil:
          it.ri = n
          return
        it = it.ri

proc add*[T](root: var BinaryTree[T], data: T) =
  # convenience proc:
  add(root, newNode(data))

iterator preorder*[T](root: BinaryTree[T]): T =
  # Preorder traversal of a binary tree.
  # Since recursive iterators are not yet implemented,
  # this uses an explicit stack (which is more efficient anyway):
  var stack: seq[BinaryTree[T]] = @[root]
  while stack.len &gt; 0:
    var n = stack.pop()
    while n != nil:
      yield n.data
      add(stack, n.ri)  # push right subtree onto the stack
      n = n.le          # and follow the left pointer

var
  root: BinaryTree[string] # instantiate a BinaryTree with ``string``
add(root, newNode("hello")) # instantiates ``newNode`` and ``add``
add(root, "world")          # instantiates the second ``add`` proc
for str in preorder(root):
  stdout.writeLine(str)</pre>
<p>The <code>T</code> is called a <span id="generic-type-parameter_1">generic type parameter</span> or a <span id="type-variable_1">type variable</span>.</p> <h3 id="generics-is-operator">Is operator</h3>
<p>The <code>is</code> operator checks for type equivalence at compile time. It is therefore very useful for type specialization within generic code:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">type
  Table[Key, Value] = object
    keys: seq[Key]
    values: seq[Value]
    when not (Key is string): # empty value for strings used for optimization
      deletedKeys: seq[bool]</pre> <h3 id="generics-type-classes">Type Classes</h3>
<p>A type class is a special pseudo-type that can be used to match against types in the context of overload resolution or the <code>is</code> operator. Nim supports the following built-in type classes:</p> <table>
<tr>
<th>type class</th>
<th>matches</th>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code>object</code></td>
<td>any object type</td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code>tuple</code></td>
<td>any tuple type</td>
</tr> <tr>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code>enum</code></td>
<td>any enumeration</td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code>proc</code></td>
<td>any proc type</td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code>ref</code></td>
<td>any <code>ref</code> type</td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code>ptr</code></td>
<td>any <code>ptr</code> type</td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code>var</code></td>
<td>any <code>var</code> type</td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code>distinct</code></td>
<td>any distinct type</td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code>array</code></td>
<td>any array type</td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code>set</code></td>
<td>any set type</td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code>seq</code></td>
<td>any seq type</td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code>auto</code></td>
<td>any type</td>
</tr> <tr>
<td><code>any</code></td>
<td>distinct auto (see below)</td>
</tr> </table>
<p>Furthermore, every generic type automatically creates a type class of the same name that will match any instantiation of the generic type.</p> <p>Type classes can be combined using the standard boolean operators to form more complex type classes:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim"># create a type class that will match all tuple and object types
type RecordType = tuple or object

proc printFields(rec: RecordType) =
  for key, value in fieldPairs(rec):
    echo key, " = ", value</pre>
<p>Procedures utilizing type classes in such manner are considered to be <span id="implicitly-generic_1">implicitly generic</span>. They will be instantiated once for each unique combination of param types used within the program.</p> <p>Nim also allows for type classes and regular types to be specified as <span id="type-constraints_1">type constraints</span> of the generic type parameter:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc onlyIntOrString[T: int|string](x, y: T) = discard

onlyIntOrString(450, 616) # valid
onlyIntOrString(5.0, 0.0) # type mismatch
onlyIntOrString("xy", 50) # invalid as 'T' cannot be both at the same time</pre>
<p>By default, during overload resolution each named type class will bind to exactly one concrete type. We call such type classes <span id="bind-once_1">bind once</span> types. Here is an example taken directly from the system module to illustrate this:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc `==`*(x, y: tuple): bool =
  ## requires `x` and `y` to be of the same tuple type
  ## generic ``==`` operator for tuples that is lifted from the components
  ## of `x` and `y`.
  result = true
  for a, b in fields(x, y):
    if a != b: result = false</pre>
<p>Alternatively, the <code>distinct</code> type modifier can be applied to the type class to allow each param matching the type class to bind to a different type. Such type classes are called <span id="bind-many_1">bind many</span> types.</p> <p>Procs written with the implicitly generic style will often need to refer to the type parameters of the matched generic type. They can be easily accessed using the dot syntax:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">type Matrix[T, Rows, Columns] = object
  ...

proc `[]`(m: Matrix, row, col: int): Matrix.T =
  m.data[col * high(Matrix.Columns) + row]</pre>
<p>Alternatively, the <em>type</em> operator can be used over the proc params for similar effect when anonymous or distinct type classes are used.</p> <p>When a generic type is instantiated with a type class instead of a concrete type, this results in another more specific type class:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">seq[ref object]  # Any sequence storing references to any object type

type T1 = auto
proc foo(s: seq[T1], e: T1)
  # seq[T1] is the same as just `seq`, but T1 will be allowed to bind
  # to a single type, while the signature is being matched

Matrix[Ordinal] # Any Matrix instantiation using integer values</pre>
<p>As seen in the previous example, in such instantiations, it's not necessary to supply all type parameters of the generic type, because any missing ones will be inferred to have the equivalent of the <em>any</em> type class and thus they will match anything without discrimination.</p> <h3 id="generics-generic-inference-restrictions">Generic inference restrictions</h3>
<p>The types <code>var T</code> and <code>typedesc[T]</code> cannot be inferred in a generic instantiation. The following is not allowed:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc g[T](f: proc(x: T); x: T) =
  f(x)

proc c(y: int) = echo y
proc v(y: var int) =
  y += 100
var i: int

# allowed: infers 'T' to be of type 'int'
g(c, 42)

# not valid: 'T' is not inferred to be of type 'var int'
g(v, i)

# also not allowed: explict instantiation via 'var int'
g[var int](v, i)</pre> <h3 id="generics-concepts">Concepts</h3>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Concepts are still in development.</p> <p>Concepts, also known as "user-defined type classes", are used to specify an arbitrary set of requirements that the matched type must satisfy.</p> <p>Concepts are written in the following form:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">type
  Comparable = concept x, y
    (x &lt; y) is bool
  
  Stack[T] = concept s, var v
    s.pop() is T
    v.push(T)
    
    s.len is Ordinal
    
    for value in s:
      value is T</pre>
<p>The concept is a match if:</p> <ol class="simple">
<li>all of the expressions within the body can be compiled for the tested type</li> <li>all statically evaluable boolean expressions in the body must be true</li> </ol> <p>The identifiers following the <code>concept</code> keyword represent instances of the currently matched type. You can apply any of the standard type modifiers such as <code>var</code>, <code>ref</code>, <code>ptr</code> and <code>static</code> to denote a more specific type of instance. You can also apply the <em>type</em> modifier to create a named instance of the type itself:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">type
  MyConcept = concept x, var v, ref r, ptr p, static s, type T
    ...</pre>
<p>Within the concept body, types can appear in positions where ordinary values and parameters are expected. This provides a more convenient way to check for the presence of callable symbols with specific signatures:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">type
  OutputStream = concept var s
    s.write(string)</pre>
<p>In order to check for symbols accepting <code>type</code> params, you must prefix the type with the explicit <code>type</code> modifier. The named instance of the type, following the <code>concept</code> keyword is also considered to have the explicit modifier and will be matched only as a type.</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">type
  # Let's imagine a user-defined casting framework with operators
  # such as `val.to(string)` and `val.to(JSonValue)`. We can test
  # for these with the following concept:
  MyCastables = concept x
    x.to(type string)
    x.to(type JSonValue)
  
  # Let's define a couple of concepts, known from Algebra:
  AdditiveMonoid* = concept x, y, type T
    x + y is T
    T.zero is T # require a proc such as `int.zero` or 'Position.zero'
  
  AdditiveGroup* = concept x, y, type T
    x is AdditiveMonoid
    -x is T
    x - y is T</pre>
<p>Please note that the <code>is</code> operator allows one to easily verify the precise type signatures of the required operations, but since type inference and default parameters are still applied in the concept body, it's also possible to describe usage protocols that do not reveal implementation details.</p> <p>Much like generics, concepts are instantiated exactly once for each tested type and any static code included within the body is executed only once.</p> <h3 id="generics-concept-diagnostics">Concept diagnostics</h3>
<p>By default, the compiler will report the matching errors in concepts only when no other overload can be selected and a normal compilation error is produced. When you need to understand why the compiler is not matching a particular concept and, as a result, a wrong overload is selected, you can apply the <code>explain</code> pragma to either the concept body or a particular call-site.</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">type
  MyConcept {.explain.} = concept ...

overloadedProc(x, y, z) {.explain.}</pre>

<p>When the concept type is matched against a concrete type, the unbound type parameters are inferred from the body of the concept in a way that closely resembles the way generic parameters of callable symbols are inferred on call sites.</p> <p>Unbound types can appear both as params to calls such as <em>s.push(T)</em> and on the right-hand side of the <code>is</code> operator in cases such as <em>x.pop is T</em> and <em>x.data is seq[T]</em>.</p> <p>Unbound static params will be inferred from expressions involving the <em>==</em> operator and also when types dependent on them are being matched:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">type
  MatrixReducer[M, N: static int; T] = concept x
    x.reduce(SquareMatrix[N, T]) is array[M, int]</pre>
<p>The Nim compiler includes a simple linear equation solver, allowing it to infer static params in some situations where integer arithmetic is involved.</p> <p>Just like in regular type classes, Nim discriminates between <code>bind once</code> and <code>bind many</code> types when matching the concept. You can add the <code>distinct</code> modifier to any of the otherwise inferable types to get a type that will be matched without permanently inferring it. This may be useful when you need to match several procs accepting the same wide class of types:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">type
  Enumerable[T] = concept e
    for v in e:
      v is T

type
  MyConcept = concept o
    # this could be inferred to a type such as Enumerable[int]
    o.foo is distinct Enumerable
    
    # this could be inferred to a different type such as Enumerable[float]
    o.bar is distinct Enumerable
    
    # it's also possible to give an alias name to a `bind many` type class
    type Enum = distinct Enumerable
    o.baz is Enum</pre>
<p>On the other hand, using <code>bind once</code> types allows you to test for equivalent types used in multiple signatures, without actually requiring any concrete types, thus allowing you to encode implementation-defined types:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">type
  MyConcept = concept x
    type T1 = auto
    x.foo(T1)
    x.bar(T1) # both procs must accept the same type
    
    type T2 = seq[SomeNumber]
    x.alpha(T2)
    x.omega(T2) # both procs must accept the same type
                # and it must be a numeric sequence</pre>
<p>As seen in the previous examples, you can refer to generic concepts such as <em>Enumerable[T]</em> just by their short name. Much like the regular generic types, the concept will be automatically instantiated with the bind once auto type in the place of each missing generic param.</p> <p>Please note that generic concepts such as <em>Enumerable[T]</em> can be matched against concrete types such as <em>string</em>. Nim doesn't require the concept type to have the same number of parameters as the type being matched. If you wish to express a requirement towards the generic parameters of the matched type, you can use a type mapping operator such as <em>genericHead</em> or <em>stripGenericParams</em> within the body of the concept to obtain the uninstantiated version of the type, which you can then try to instantiate in any required way. For example, here is how one might define the classic <em>Functor</em> concept from Haskell and then demonstrate that Nim's <em>Option[T]</em> type is an instance of it:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">import sugar, typetraits

type
  Functor[A] = concept f
    type MatchedGenericType = genericHead(f.type)
      # `f` will be a value of a type such as `Option[T]`
      # `MatchedGenericType` will become the `Option` type
    
    f.val is A
      # The Functor should provide a way to obtain
      # a value stored inside it
    
    type T = auto
    map(f, A -&gt; T) is MatchedGenericType[T]
      # And it should provide a way to map one instance of
      # the Functor to a instance of a different type, given
      # a suitable `map` operation for the enclosed values

import options
echo Option[int] is Functor # prints true</pre> <h3 id="generics-concept-derived-values">Concept derived values</h3>
<p>All top level constants or types appearing within the concept body are accessible through the dot operator in procs where the concept was successfully matched to a concrete type:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">type
  DateTime = concept t1, t2, type T
    const Min = T.MinDate
    T.Now is T
    
    t1 &lt; t2 is bool
    
    type TimeSpan = type(t1 - t2)
    TimeSpan * int is TimeSpan
    TimeSpan + TimeSpan is TimeSpan
    
    t1 + TimeSpan is T

proc eventsJitter(events: Enumerable[DateTime]): float =
  var
    # this variable will have the inferred TimeSpan type for
    # the concrete Date-like value the proc was called with:
    averageInterval: DateTime.TimeSpan
    
    deviation: float
  ...</pre> <h3 id="generics-concept-refinement">Concept refinement</h3>
<p>When the matched type within a concept is directly tested against a different concept, we say that the outer concept is a refinement of the inner concept and thus it is more-specific. When both concepts are matched in a call during overload resolution, Nim will assign a higher precedence to the most specific one. As an alternative way of defining concept refinements, you can use the object inheritance syntax involving the <code>of</code> keyword:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">type
  Graph = concept g, type G of EqualyComparable, Copyable
    type
      VertexType = G.VertexType
      EdgeType = G.EdgeType
    
    VertexType is Copyable
    EdgeType is Copyable
    
    var
      v: VertexType
      e: EdgeType
  
  IncidendeGraph = concept of Graph
    # symbols such as variables and types from the refined
    # concept are automatically in scope:
    
    g.source(e) is VertexType
    g.target(e) is VertexType
    
    g.outgoingEdges(v) is Enumerable[EdgeType]
  
  BidirectionalGraph = concept g, type G
    # The following will also turn the concept into a refinement when it
    # comes to overload resolution, but it doesn't provide the convenient
    # symbol inheritance
    g is IncidendeGraph
    
    g.incomingEdges(G.VertexType) is Enumerable[G.EdgeType]

proc f(g: IncidendeGraph)
proc f(g: BidirectionalGraph) # this one will be preferred if we pass a type
                              # matching the BidirectionalGraph concept</pre> <h3 id="generics-symbol-lookup-in-generics">Symbol lookup in generics</h3> <h4 id="symbol-lookup-in-generics-open-and-closed-symbols">Open and Closed symbols</h4>
<p>The symbol binding rules in generics are slightly subtle: There are "open" and "closed" symbols. A "closed" symbol cannot be re-bound in the instantiation context, an "open" symbol can. Per default overloaded symbols are open and every other symbol is closed.</p> <p>Open symbols are looked up in two different contexts: Both the context at definition and the context at instantiation are considered:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">type
  Index = distinct int

proc `==` (a, b: Index): bool {.borrow.}

var a = (0, 0.Index)
var b = (0, 0.Index)

echo a == b # works!</pre>
<p>In the example the generic <code>==</code> for tuples (as defined in the system module) uses the <code>==</code> operators of the tuple's components. However, the <code>==</code> for the <code>Index</code> type is defined <em>after</em> the <code>==</code> for tuples; yet the example compiles as the instantiation takes the currently defined symbols into account too.</p> <h3 id="generics-mixin-statement">Mixin statement</h3>
<p>A symbol can be forced to be open by a <span id="mixin_1">mixin</span> declaration:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc create*[T](): ref T =
  # there is no overloaded 'init' here, so we need to state that it's an
  # open symbol explicitly:
  mixin init
  new result
  init result</pre> <h3 id="generics-bind-statement">Bind statement</h3>
<p>The <code>bind</code> statement is the counterpart to the <code>mixin</code> statement. It can be used to explicitly declare identifiers that should be bound early (i.e. the identifiers should be looked up in the scope of the template/generic definition):</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim"># Module A
var
  lastId = 0

template genId*: untyped =
  bind lastId
  inc(lastId)
  lastId</pre>
<pre class="listing" data-language="nim"># Module B
import A

echo genId()</pre>
<p>But a <code>bind</code> is rarely useful because symbol binding from the definition scope is the default.</p> <h2 id="templates">Templates</h2>
<p>A template is a simple form of a macro: It is a simple substitution mechanism that operates on Nim's abstract syntax trees. It is processed in the semantic pass of the compiler.</p> <p>The syntax to <em>invoke</em> a template is the same as calling a procedure.</p> <p>Example:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">template `!=` (a, b: untyped): untyped =
  # this definition exists in the System module
  not (a == b)

assert(5 != 6) # the compiler rewrites that to: assert(not (5 == 6))</pre>
<p>The <code>!=</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>, <code>in</code>, <code>notin</code>, <code>isnot</code> operators are in fact templates:</p> <p><code>a &gt; b</code> is transformed into <code>b &lt; a</code>.<br><code>a in b</code> is transformed into <code>contains(b, a)</code>.<br><code>notin</code> and <code>isnot</code> have the obvious meanings.<br></p>
<p>The "types" of templates can be the symbols <code>untyped</code>, <code>typed</code> or <code>type</code>. These are "meta types", they can only be used in certain contexts. Regular types can be used too; this implies that <code>typed</code> expressions are expected.</p> <h3 id="templates-typed-vs-untyped-parameters">Typed vs untyped parameters</h3>
<p>An <code>untyped</code> parameter means that symbol lookups and type resolution is not performed before the expression is passed to the template. This means that for example <em>undeclared</em> identifiers can be passed to the template:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">template declareInt(x: untyped) =
  var x: int

declareInt(x) # valid
x = 3</pre>
<pre class="listing" data-language="nim">template declareInt(x: typed) =
  var x: int

declareInt(x) # invalid, because x has not been declared and so has no type</pre>
<p>A template where every parameter is <code>untyped</code> is called an <span id="immediate_1">immediate</span> template. For historical reasons templates can be explicitly annotated with an <code>immediate</code> pragma and then these templates do not take part in overloading resolution and the parameters' types are <em>ignored</em> by the compiler. Explicit immediate templates are now deprecated.</p> <p><strong>Note</strong>: For historical reasons <code>stmt</code> is an alias for <code>typed</code> and <code>expr</code> an alias for <code>untyped</code>, but new code should use the newer, clearer names.</p> <h3 id="templates-passing-a-code-block-to-a-template">Passing a code block to a template</h3>
<p>You can pass a block of statements as the last argument to a template following the special <code>:</code> syntax:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">template withFile(f, fn, mode, actions: untyped): untyped =
  var f: File
  if open(f, fn, mode):
    try:
      actions
    finally:
      close(f)
  else:
    quit("cannot open: " &amp; fn)

withFile(txt, "ttempl3.txt", fmWrite):  # special colon
  txt.writeLine("line 1")
  txt.writeLine("line 2")</pre>
<p>In the example, the two <code>writeLine</code> statements are bound to the <code>actions</code> parameter.</p> <p>Usually to pass a block of code to a template the parameter that accepts the block needs to be of type <code>untyped</code>. Because symbol lookups are then delayed until template instantiation time:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">template t(body: typed) =
  block:
    body

t:
  var i = 1
  echo i

t:
  var i = 2  # fails with 'attempt to redeclare i'
  echo i</pre>
<p>The above code fails with the mysterious error message that <code>i</code> has already been declared. The reason for this is that the <code>var i = ...</code> bodies need to be type-checked before they are passed to the <code>body</code> parameter and type checking in Nim implies symbol lookups. For the symbol lookups to succeed <code>i</code> needs to be added to the current (i.e. outer) scope. After type checking these additions to the symbol table are not rolled back (for better or worse). The same code works with <code>untyped</code> as the passed body is not required to be type-checked:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">template t(body: untyped) =
  block:
    body

t:
  var i = 1
  echo i

t:
  var i = 2  # compiles
  echo i</pre> <h3 id="templates-varargs-of-untyped">Varargs of untyped</h3>
<p>In addition to the <code>untyped</code> meta-type that prevents type checking there is also <code>varargs[untyped]</code> so that not even the number of parameters is fixed:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">template hideIdentifiers(x: varargs[untyped]) = discard

hideIdentifiers(undeclared1, undeclared2)</pre>
<p>However, since a template cannot iterate over varargs, this feature is generally much more useful for macros.</p> <p><strong>Note</strong>: For historical reasons <code>varargs[expr]</code> is not equivalent to <code>varargs[untyped]</code>.</p> <h3 id="templates-symbol-binding-in-templates">Symbol binding in templates</h3>
<p>A template is a <span id="hygienic_1">hygienic</span> macro and so opens a new scope. Most symbols are bound from the definition scope of the template:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim"># Module A
var
  lastId = 0

template genId*: untyped =
  inc(lastId)
  lastId</pre>
<pre class="listing" data-language="nim"># Module B
import A

echo genId() # Works as 'lastId' has been bound in 'genId's defining scope</pre>
<p>As in generics symbol binding can be influenced via <code>mixin</code> or <code>bind</code> statements.</p> <h3 id="templates-identifier-construction">Identifier construction</h3>
<p>In templates identifiers can be constructed with the backticks notation:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">template typedef(name: untyped, typ: type) =
  type
    `T name`* {.inject.} = typ
    `P name`* {.inject.} = ref `T name`

typedef(myint, int)
var x: PMyInt</pre>
<p>In the example <code>name</code> is instantiated with <code>myint</code>, so `T name` becomes <code>Tmyint</code>.</p> <h3 id="templates-lookup-rules-for-template-parameters">Lookup rules for template parameters</h3>
<p>A parameter <code>p</code> in a template is even substituted in the expression <code>x.p</code>. Thus template arguments can be used as field names and a global symbol can be shadowed by the same argument name even when fully qualified:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim"># module 'm'

type
  Lev = enum
    levA, levB

var abclev = levB

template tstLev(abclev: Lev) =
  echo abclev, " ", m.abclev

tstLev(levA)
# produces: 'levA levA'</pre>
<p>But the global symbol can properly be captured by a <code>bind</code> statement:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim"># module 'm'

type
  Lev = enum
    levA, levB

var abclev = levB

template tstLev(abclev: Lev) =
  bind m.abclev
  echo abclev, " ", m.abclev

tstLev(levA)
# produces: 'levA levB'</pre> <h3 id="templates-hygiene-in-templates">Hygiene in templates</h3>
<p>Per default templates are <span id="hygienic_2">hygienic</span>: Local identifiers declared in a template cannot be accessed in the instantiation context:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">template newException*(exceptn: type, message: string): untyped =
  var
    e: ref exceptn  # e is implicitly gensym'ed here
  new(e)
  e.msg = message
  e

# so this works:
let e = "message"
raise newException(IoError, e)</pre>
<p>Whether a symbol that is declared in a template is exposed to the instantiation scope is controlled by the <span id="inject_1">inject</span> and <span id="gensym_1">gensym</span> pragmas: gensym'ed symbols are not exposed but inject'ed are.</p> <p>The default for symbols of entity <code>type</code>, <code>var</code>, <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> is <code>gensym</code> and for <code>proc</code>, <code>iterator</code>, <code>converter</code>, <code>template</code>, <code>macro</code> is <code>inject</code>. However, if the name of the entity is passed as a template parameter, it is an inject'ed symbol:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">template withFile(f, fn, mode: untyped, actions: untyped): untyped =
  block:
    var f: File  # since 'f' is a template param, it's injected implicitly
    ...

withFile(txt, "ttempl3.txt", fmWrite):
  txt.writeLine("line 1")
  txt.writeLine("line 2")</pre>
<p>The <code>inject</code> and <code>gensym</code> pragmas are second class annotations; they have no semantics outside of a template definition and cannot be abstracted over:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">{.pragma myInject: inject.}

template t() =
  var x {.myInject.}: int # does NOT work</pre>
<p>To get rid of hygiene in templates, one can use the <span id="dirty_1">dirty</span> pragma for a template. <code>inject</code> and <code>gensym</code> have no effect in <code>dirty</code> templates.</p> <h3 id="templates-limitations-of-the-method-call-syntax">Limitations of the method call syntax</h3>
<p>The expression <code>x</code> in <code>x.f</code> needs to be semantically checked (that means symbol lookup and type checking) before it can be decided that it needs to be rewritten to <code>f(x)</code>. Therefore the dot syntax has some limitations when it is used to invoke templates/macros:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">template declareVar(name: untyped) =
  const name {.inject.} = 45

# Doesn't compile:
unknownIdentifier.declareVar</pre>
<p>Another common example is this:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">from sequtils import toSeq

iterator something: string =
  yield "Hello"
  yield "World"

var info = something().toSeq</pre>
<p>The problem here is that the compiler already decided that <code>something()</code> as an iterator is not callable in this context before <code>toSeq</code> gets its chance to convert it into a sequence.</p> <h2 id="macros">Macros</h2>
<p>A macro is a special function that is executed at compile-time. Normally the input for a macro is an abstract syntax tree (AST) of the code that is passed to it. The macro can then do transformations on it and return the transformed AST. The transformed AST is then passed to the compiler as if the macro invocation would have been replaced by its result in the source code. This can be used to implement <span id="domain-specific-languages_1">domain specific languages</span>.</p> <p>While macros enable advanced compile-time code transformations, they cannot change Nim's syntax. However, this is no real restriction because Nim's syntax is flexible enough anyway.</p> <p>To write macros, one needs to know how the Nim concrete syntax is converted to an AST.</p> <p>There are two ways to invoke a macro:</p> <ol class="simple">
<li>invoking a macro like a procedure call (<em>expression macros</em>)</li> <li>invoking a macro with the special <code>macrostmt</code> syntax (<em>statement macros</em>)</li> </ol> <h3 id="macros-expression-macros">Expression Macros</h3>
<p>The following example implements a powerful <code>debug</code> command that accepts a variable number of arguments:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim"># to work with Nim syntax trees, we need an API that is defined in the
# ``macros`` module:
import macros

macro debug(args: varargs[untyped]): untyped =
  # `args` is a collection of `NimNode` values that each contain the
  # AST for an argument of the macro. A macro always has to
  # return a `NimNode`. A node of kind `nnkStmtList` is suitable for
  # this use case.
  result = nnkStmtList.newTree()
  # iterate over any argument that is passed to this macro:
  for n in args:
    # add a call to the statement list that writes the expression;
    # `toStrLit` converts an AST to its string representation:
    result.add newCall("write", newIdentNode("stdout"), newLit(n.repr))
    # add a call to the statement list that writes ": "
    result.add newCall("write", newIdentNode("stdout"), newLit(": "))
    # add a call to the statement list that writes the expressions value:
    result.add newCall("writeLine", newIdentNode("stdout"), n)

var
  a: array[0..10, int]
  x = "some string"
a[0] = 42
a[1] = 45

<p>The macro call expands to:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">write(stdout, "a[0]")
write(stdout, ": ")
writeLine(stdout, a[0])

write(stdout, "a[1]")
write(stdout, ": ")
writeLine(stdout, a[1])

write(stdout, "x")
write(stdout, ": ")
writeLine(stdout, x)</pre>
<p>Arguments that are passed to a <code>varargs</code> parameter are wrapped in an array constructor expression. This is why <code>debug</code> iterates over all of <code>n</code>'s children.</p> <h3 id="macros-bindsym">BindSym</h3>
<p>The above <code>debug</code> macro relies on the fact that <code>write</code>, <code>writeLine</code> and <code>stdout</code> are declared in the system module and thus visible in the instantiating context. There is a way to use bound identifiers (aka <span id="symbols_1">symbols</span>) instead of using unbound identifiers. The <code>bindSym</code> builtin can be used for that:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">import macros

macro debug(n: varargs[typed]): untyped =
  result = newNimNode(nnkStmtList, n)
  for x in n:
    # we can bind symbols in scope via 'bindSym':
    add(result, newCall(bindSym"write", bindSym"stdout", toStrLit(x)))
    add(result, newCall(bindSym"write", bindSym"stdout", newStrLitNode(": ")))
    add(result, newCall(bindSym"writeLine", bindSym"stdout", x))

var
  a: array[0..10, int]
  x = "some string"
a[0] = 42
a[1] = 45

debug(a[0], a[1], x)</pre>
<p>The macro call expands to:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">write(stdout, "a[0]")
write(stdout, ": ")
writeLine(stdout, a[0])

write(stdout, "a[1]")
write(stdout, ": ")
writeLine(stdout, a[1])

write(stdout, "x")
write(stdout, ": ")
writeLine(stdout, x)</pre>
<p>However, the symbols <code>write</code>, <code>writeLine</code> and <code>stdout</code> are already bound and are not looked up again. As the example shows, <code>bindSym</code> does work with overloaded symbols implicitly.</p> <h3 id="macros-statement-macros">Statement Macros</h3>
<p>Statement macros are defined just as expression macros. However, they are invoked by an expression following a colon.</p> <p>The following example outlines a macro that generates a lexical analyzer from regular expressions:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">import macros

<p>Currently case statement macros must be enabled explicitly via <code>{.experimental: "caseStmtMacros".}</code>.</p> <p><code>match</code> macros are subject to overload resolution. First the <code>case</code>'s selector expression is used to determine which <code>match</code> macro to call. To this macro is then passed the complete <code>case</code> statement body and the macro is evaluated.</p> <p>In other words, the macro needs to transform the full <code>case</code> statement but only the statement's selector expression is used to determine which macro to call.</p> <h2 id="special-types">Special Types</h2> <h3 id="special-types-static-t">static[T]</h3>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: static[T] is still in development.</p> <p>As their name suggests, static parameters must be known at compile-time:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc precompiledRegex(pattern: static string): RegEx =
  var res {.global.} = re(pattern)
  return res

precompiledRegex("/d+") # Replaces the call with a precompiled
                        # regex, stored in a global variable

precompiledRegex(paramStr(1)) # Error, command-line options
                              # are not known at compile-time</pre>
<p>For the purposes of code generation, all static params are treated as generic params - the proc will be compiled separately for each unique supplied value (or combination of values).</p> <p>Static params can also appear in the signatures of generic types:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">type
  Matrix[M,N: static int; T: Number] = array[0..(M*N - 1), T]
    # Note how `Number` is just a type constraint here, while
    # `static int` requires us to supply a compile-time int value
  
  AffineTransform2D[T] = Matrix[3, 3, T]
  AffineTransform3D[T] = Matrix[4, 4, T]

var m1: AffineTransform3D[float]  # OK
var m2: AffineTransform2D[string] # Error, `string` is not a `Number`</pre>
<p>Please note that <code>static T</code> is just a syntactic convenience for the underlying generic type <code>static[T]</code>. The type param can be omitted to obtain the type class of all values known at compile-time. A more specific type class can be created by instantiating <code>static</code> with another type class.</p> <p>You can force the evaluation of a certain expression at compile-time by coercing it to a corresponding <code>static</code> type:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">import math

echo static(fac(5)), " ", static[bool](16.isPowerOfTwo)</pre>
<p>The complier will report any failure to evaluate the expression or a possible type mismatch error.</p> <h3 id="special-types-type-t">type[T]</h3>
<p>In many contexts, Nim allows you to treat the names of types as regular values. These values exists only during the compilation phase, but since all values must have a type, <code>type</code> is considered their special type.</p> <p><code>type</code> acts like a generic type. For instance, the type of the symbol <code>int</code> is <code>type[int]</code>. Just like with regular generic types, when the generic param is ommited, <code>type</code> denotes the type class of all types. As a syntactic convenience, you can also use <code>type</code> as a modifier. <code>type int</code> is considered the same as <code>type[int]</code>.</p> <p>Procs featuring <code>type</code> params are considered implicitly generic. They will be instantiated for each unique combination of supplied types and within the body of the proc, the name of each param will refer to the bound concrete type:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc new(T: type): ref T =
  echo "allocating ", T.name
  new(result)

var n = Node.new
var tree = new(BinaryTree[int])</pre>
<p>When multiple type params are present, they will bind freely to different types. To force a bind-once behavior one can use an explicit generic param:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc acceptOnlyTypePairs[T, U](A, B: type[T]; C, D: type[U])</pre>
<p>Once bound, type params can appear in the rest of the proc signature:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">template declareVariableWithType(T: type, value: T) =
  var x: T = value

declareVariableWithType int, 42</pre>
<p>Overload resolution can be further influenced by constraining the set of types that will match the type param:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">template maxval(T: type int): int = high(int)
template maxval(T: type float): float = Inf

var i = int.maxval
var f = float.maxval
when false:
  var s = string.maxval # error, maxval is not implemented for string</pre>
<p>The constraint can be a concrete type or a type class.</p> <h3 id="special-types-type-operator">type operator</h3>
<p>You can obtain the type of a given expression by constructing a <code>type</code> value from it (in many other languages this is known as the <span id="typeof_1">typeof</span> operator):</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">var x = 0
var y: type(x) # y has type int</pre>
<p>You may add a constraint to the resulting type to trigger a compile-time error if the expression doesn't have the expected type:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">var x = 0
var y: type[object](x) # Error: type mismatch: got &lt;int&gt; but expected 'object'</pre>
<p>If <code>type</code> is used to determine the result type of a proc/iterator/converter call <code>c(X)</code> (where <code>X</code> stands for a possibly empty list of arguments), the interpretation where <code>c</code> is an iterator is preferred over the other interpretations:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">import strutils

# strutils contains both a ``split`` proc and iterator, but since an
# an iterator is the preferred interpretation, `y` has the type ``string``:
var y: type("a b c".split)</pre> <h2 id="special-operators">Special Operators</h2> <h3 id="special-operators-dot-operators">dot operators</h3>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Dot operators are still experimental and so need to be enabled via <code>{.experimental: "dotOperators".}</code>.</p> <p>Nim offers a special family of dot operators that can be used to intercept and rewrite proc call and field access attempts, referring to previously undeclared symbol names. They can be used to provide a fluent interface to objects lying outside the static confines of the type system such as values from dynamic scripting languages or dynamic file formats such as JSON or XML.</p> <p>When Nim encounters an expression that cannot be resolved by the standard overload resolution rules, the current scope will be searched for a dot operator that can be matched against a re-written form of the expression, where the unknown field or proc name is passed to an <code>untyped</code> parameter:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">a.b # becomes `.`(a, b)
a.b(c, d) # becomes `.`(a, b, c, d)</pre>
<p>The matched dot operators can be symbols of any callable kind (procs, templates and macros), depending on the desired effect:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">template `.` (js: PJsonNode, field: untyped): JSON = js[astToStr(field)]

var js = parseJson("{ x: 1, y: 2}")
echo js.x # outputs 1
echo js.y # outputs 2</pre>
<p>The following dot operators are available:</p> <h3 id="special-operators-operator-dot">operator <em>.</em>
</h3>
<p>This operator will be matched against both field accesses and method calls.</p> <h3 id="special-operators-operator-dot">operator <em>.()</em>
</h3>
<p>This operator will be matched exclusively against method calls. It has higher precedence than the <em>.</em> operator and this allows one to handle expressions like <em>x.y</em> and <em>x.y()</em> differently if one is interfacing with a scripting language for example.</p> <h3 id="special-operators-operator-doteq">operator <em>.=</em>
</h3>
<p>This operator will be matched against assignments to missing fields.</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">a.b = c # becomes `.=`(a, b, c)</pre> <h2 id="type-bound-operations">Type bound operations</h2>
<p>There are 3 operations that are bound to a type:</p> <ol class="simple">
<li>Assignment</li> <li>Destruction</li> <li>Deep copying for communication between threads</li> </ol> <p>These operations can be <em>overridden</em> instead of <em>overloaded</em>. This means the implementation is automatically lifted to structured types. For instance if type <code>T</code> has an overridden assignment operator <code>=</code> this operator is also used for assignments of the type <code>seq[T]</code>. Since these operations are bound to a type they have to be bound to a nominal type for reasons of simplicity of implementation: This means an overridden <code>deepCopy</code> for <code>ref T</code> is really bound to <code>T</code> and not to <code>ref T</code>. This also means that one cannot override <code>deepCopy</code> for both <code>ptr T</code> and <code>ref T</code> at the same time; instead a helper distinct or object type has to be used for one pointer type.</p> <h3 id="type-bound-operations-operator-eq">operator <em>=</em>
</h3>
<p>This operator is the assignment operator. Note that in the contexts <code>result = expr</code>, <code>parameter = defaultValue</code> or for parameter passing no assignment is performed. For a type <code>T</code> that has an overloaded assignment operator <code>var v = T()</code> is rewritten to <code>var v: T; v = T()</code>; in other words <code>var</code> and <code>let</code> contexts do count as assignments.</p> <p>The assignment operator needs to be attached to an object or distinct type <code>T</code>. Its signature has to be <code>(var T, T)</code>. Example:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">type
  Concrete = object
    a, b: string

proc `=`(d: var Concrete; src: Concrete) =
  shallowCopy(d.a, src.a)
  shallowCopy(d.b, src.b)
  echo "Concrete '=' called"

var x, y: array[0..2, Concrete]
var cA, cB: Concrete

var cATup, cBTup: tuple[x: int, ha: Concrete]

x = y
cA = cB
cATup = cBTup</pre> <h3 id="type-bound-operations-destructors">destructors</h3>
<p>A destructor must have a single parameter with a concrete type (the name of a generic type is allowed too). The name of the destructor has to be <code>=destroy</code>.</p> <p><code>=destroy(v)</code> will be automatically invoked for every local stack variable <code>v</code> that goes out of scope.</p> <p>If a structured type features a field with destructable type and the user has not provided an explicit implementation, a destructor for the structured type will be automatically generated. Calls to any base class destructors in both user-defined and generated destructors will be inserted.</p> <p>A destructor is attached to the type it destructs; expressions of this type can then only be used in <em>destructible contexts</em> and as parameters:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">type
  MyObj = object
    x, y: int
    p: pointer

proc `=destroy`(o: var MyObj) =
  if o.p != nil: dealloc o.p

proc open: MyObj =
  result = MyObj(x: 1, y: 2, p: alloc(3))

proc work(o: MyObj) =
  echo o.x
  # No destructor invoked here for 'o' as 'o' is a parameter.

proc main() =
  # destructor automatically invoked at the end of the scope:
  var x = open()
  # valid: pass 'x' to some other proc:
  work(x)
  
  # Error: usage of a type with a destructor in a non destructible context
  echo open()</pre>
<p>A destructible context is currently only the following:</p> <ol class="simple">
<li>The <code>expr</code> in <code>var x = expr</code>.</li> <li>The <code>expr</code> in <code>let x = expr</code>.</li> <li>The <code>expr</code> in <code>return expr</code>.</li> <li>The <code>expr</code> in <code>result = expr</code> where <code>result</code> is the special symbol introduced by the compiler.</li> </ol> <p>These rules ensure that the construction is tied to a variable and can easily be destructed at its scope exit. Later versions of the language will improve the support of destructors.</p> <p>Be aware that destructors are not called for objects allocated with <code>new</code>. This may change in future versions of language, but for now the <span id="finalizer_1">finalizer</span> parameter to <code>new</code> has to be used.</p> <p><strong>Note</strong>: Destructors are still experimental and the spec might change significantly in order to incorporate an escape analysis.</p> <h3 id="type-bound-operations-deepcopy">deepCopy</h3>
<p><code>=deepCopy</code> is a builtin that is invoked whenever data is passed to a <code>spawn</code>'ed proc to ensure memory safety. The programmer can override its behaviour for a specific <code>ref</code> or <code>ptr</code> type <code>T</code>. (Later versions of the language may weaken this restriction.)</p> <p>The signature has to be:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc `=deepCopy`(x: T): T</pre>
<p>This mechanism will be used by most data structures that support shared memory like channels to implement thread safe automatic memory management.</p> <p>The builtin <code>deepCopy</code> can even clone closures and their environments. See the documentation of <a href="#parallel-spawn">spawn</a> for details.</p> <h2 id="term-rewriting-macros">Term rewriting macros</h2>
<p>Term rewriting macros are macros or templates that have not only a <em>name</em> but also a <em>pattern</em> that is searched for after the semantic checking phase of the compiler: This means they provide an easy way to enhance the compilation pipeline with user defined optimizations:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">template optMul{`*`(a, 2)}(a: int): int = a+a

let x = 3
echo x * 2</pre>
<p>The compiler now rewrites <code>x * 2</code> as <code>x + x</code>. The code inside the curlies is the pattern to match against. The operators <code>*</code>, <code>**</code>, <code>|</code>, <code>~</code> have a special meaning in patterns if they are written in infix notation, so to match verbatim against <code>*</code> the ordinary function call syntax needs to be used.</p> <p>Unfortunately optimizations are hard to get right and even the tiny example is <strong>wrong</strong>:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">template optMul{`*`(a, 2)}(a: int): int = a+a

proc f(): int =
  echo "side effect!"
  result = 55

echo f() * 2</pre>
<p>We cannot duplicate 'a' if it denotes an expression that has a side effect! Fortunately Nim supports side effect analysis:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">template optMul{`*`(a, 2)}(a: int{noSideEffect}): int = a+a

proc f(): int =
  echo "side effect!"
  result = 55

echo f() * 2 # not optimized ;-)</pre>
<p>You can make one overload matching with a constraint and one without, and the one with a constraint will have precedence, and so you can handle both cases differently.</p> <p>So what about <code>2 * a</code>? We should tell the compiler <code>*</code> is commutative. We cannot really do that however as the following code only swaps arguments blindly:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">template mulIsCommutative{`*`(a, b)}(a, b: int): int = b*a</pre>
<p>What optimizers really need to do is a <em>canonicalization</em>:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">template canonMul{`*`(a, b)}(a: int{lit}, b: int): int = b*a</pre>
<p>The <code>int{lit}</code> parameter pattern matches against an expression of type <code>int</code>, but only if it's a literal.</p> <h3 id="term-rewriting-macros-parameter-constraints">Parameter constraints</h3>
<p>The <span id="parameter-constraint_1">parameter constraint</span> expression can use the operators <code>|</code> (or), <code>&amp;</code> (and) and <code>~</code> (not) and the following predicates:</p> <table>

<p>Predicates that share their name with a keyword have to be escaped with backticks: `` <em>const</em> <code>. The ``alias</code> and <code>noalias</code> predicates refer not only to the matching AST, but also to every other bound parameter; syntactically they need to occur after the ordinary AST predicates:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">template ex{a = b + c}(a: int{noalias}, b, c: int) =

<p>The operators <code>*</code>, <code>**</code>, <code>|</code>, <code>~</code> have a special meaning in patterns if they are written in infix notation.</p> <h4 id="pattern-operators-the-bar-operator">The <code>|</code> operator</h4>
<p>The <code>|</code> operator if used as infix operator creates an ordered choice:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">template t{0|1}(): untyped = 3
let a = 1
# outputs 3:

<p>The matching is performed after the compiler performed some optimizations like constant folding, so the following does not work:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">template t{0|1}(): untyped = 3
# outputs 1:

<p>The reason is that the compiler already transformed the 1 into "1" for the <code>echo</code> statement. However, a term rewriting macro should not change the semantics anyway. In fact they can be deactivated with the <code>--patterns:off</code> command line option or temporarily with the <code>patterns</code> pragma.</p> <h4 id="pattern-operators-the-operator">The <code>{}</code> operator</h4>
<p>A pattern expression can be bound to a pattern parameter via the <code>expr{param}</code> notation:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">template t{(0|1|2){x}}(x: untyped): untyped = x+1
let a = 1
# outputs 2:

<p>The second operator of <em>*</em> must be a parameter; it is used to gather all the arguments. The expression <code>"my" &amp;&amp; (space &amp; "awe" &amp;&amp; "some " ) &amp;&amp; "concat"</code> is passed to <code>optConc</code> in <code>a</code> as a special list (of kind <code>nkArgList</code>) which is flattened into a call expression; thus the invocation of <code>optConc</code> produces:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">`&amp;&amp;`("my", space &amp; "awe", "some ", "concat")</pre> <h4 id="pattern-operators-the-starstar-operator">The <code>**</code> operator</h4>

  echo match("W_HI_Le", peg"\y 'while'")</pre>
<p>The <code>optPeg</code> template optimizes the case of a peg constructor with a string literal, so that the pattern will only be parsed once at program startup and stored in a global <code>gl</code> which is then re-used.

<p>Nim supports splitting a program into pieces by a module concept. Each module needs to be in its own file and has its own <span id="namespace_1">namespace</span>. Modules enable <span id="information-hiding_1">information hiding</span> and <span id="separate-compilation_1">separate compilation</span>. A module may gain access to symbols of another module by the <span id="import_1">import</span> statement. <span id="recursive-module-dependencies_1">Recursive module dependencies</span> are allowed, but slightly subtle. Only top-level symbols that are marked with an asterisk (<code>*</code>) are exported. A valid module name can only be a valid Nim identifier (and thus its filename is <code>identifier.nim</code>).</p> <p>The algorithm for compiling modules is:</p> <ul class="simple">
<li>compile the whole module as usual, following import statements recursively</li> <li>if there is a cycle only import the already parsed symbols (that are exported); if an unknown identifier occurs then abort</li> </ul> <p>This is best illustrated by an example:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim"># Module A
type
  T1* = int  # Module A exports the type ``T1``
import B     # the compiler starts parsing B

proc main() =
  var i = p(3) # works because B has been parsed completely here

<pre class="listing" data-language="nim"># Module B
import A  # A is not parsed here! Only the already known symbols
          # of A are imported.

proc p*(x: A.T1): A.T1 =
  # this works because the compiler has already
  # added T1 to A's interface symbol table
  result = x + 1</pre> <h4 id="modules-import-statement">Import statement</h4>
<p>After the <code>import</code> statement a list of module names can follow or a single module name followed by an <code>except</code> list to prevent some symbols to be imported:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">import strutils except `%`, toUpperAscii

# doesn't work then:
echo "$1" % "abc".toUpperAscii</pre>
<p>It is not checked that the <code>except</code> list is really exported from the module. This feature allows to compile against an older version of the module that does not export these identifiers.</p> <h4 id="modules-include-statement">Include statement</h4>
<p>The <code>include</code> statement does something fundamentally different than importing a module: it merely includes the contents of a file. The <code>include</code> statement is useful to split up a large module into several files:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">include fileA, fileB, fileC</pre> <h4 id="modules-module-names-in-imports">Module names in imports</h4>
<p>A module alias can be introduced via the <code>as</code> keyword:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">import strutils as su, sequtils as qu

echo su.format("$1", "lalelu")</pre>
<p>The original module name is then not accessible. The notations <code>path/to/module</code> or <code>"path/to/module"</code> can be used to refer to a module in subdirectories:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">import lib/pure/os, "lib/pure/times"</pre>
<p>Note that the module name is still <code>strutils</code> and not <code>lib/pure/strutils</code> and so one <strong>cannot</strong> do:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">import lib/pure/strutils
echo lib/pure/strutils.toUpperAscii("abc")</pre>
<p>Likewise the following does not make sense as the name is <code>strutils</code> already:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">import lib/pure/strutils as strutils</pre> <h4 id="modules-collective-imports-from-a-directory">Collective imports from a directory</h4>
<p>The syntax <code>import dir / [moduleA, moduleB]</code> can be used to import multiple modules from the same directory.</p> <p>Path names are syntactically either Nim identifiers or string literals. If the path name is not a valid Nim identifier it needs to be a string literal:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">import "gfx/3d/somemodule" # in quotes because '3d' is not a valid Nim identifier</pre> <h4 id="modules-pseudo-importslashinclude-paths">Pseudo import/include paths</h4>
<p>A directory can also be a so called "pseudo directory". They can be used to avoid ambiguity when there are multiple modules with the same path.</p> <p>There are two pseudo directories:</p> <p>1. <code>std</code>: The <code>std</code> pseudo directory is the abstract location of Nim's standard library. For example, the syntax <code>import std / strutils</code> is used to unambiguously refer to the standard library's <code>strutils</code> module.</p> <p>2. <code>pkg</code>: The <code>pkg</code> pseudo directory is used to unambiguously refer to a Nimble package. However, for technical details that lie outside of the scope of this document its semantics are: <em>Use the search path to look for module name but ignore the standard library locations</em>. In other words, it is the opposite of <code>std</code>.</p> <h4 id="modules-from-import-statement">From import statement</h4>
<p>After the <code>from</code> statement a module name follows followed by an <code>import</code> to list the symbols one likes to use without explicit full qualification:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">from strutils import `%`

echo "$1" % "abc"
# always possible: full qualification:
echo strutils.replace("abc", "a", "z")</pre>
<p>It's also possible to use <code>from module import nil</code> if one wants to import the module but wants to enforce fully qualified access to every symbol in <code>module</code>.</p> <h4 id="modules-export-statement">Export statement</h4>
<p>An <code>export</code> statement can be used for symbol forwarding so that client modules don't need to import a module's dependencies:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim"># module B
type MyObject* = object</pre>
<pre class="listing" data-language="nim"># module A
import B
export B.MyObject

proc `$`*(x: MyObject): string = "my object"</pre>
<pre class="listing" data-language="nim"># module C
import A

# B.MyObject has been imported implicitly here:
var x: MyObject
echo $x</pre>
<p>When the exported symbol is another module, all of its definitions will be forwarded. You can use an <code>except</code> list to exclude some of the symbols.</p> <h3 id="modules-scope-rules">Scope rules</h3>
<p>Identifiers are valid from the point of their declaration until the end of the block in which the declaration occurred. The range where the identifier is known is the scope of the identifier. The exact scope of an identifier depends on the way it was declared.</p> <h4 id="scope-rules-block-scope">Block scope</h4>
<p>The <em>scope</em> of a variable declared in the declaration part of a block is valid from the point of declaration until the end of the block. If a block contains a second block, in which the identifier is redeclared, then inside this block, the second declaration will be valid. Upon leaving the inner block, the first declaration is valid again. An identifier cannot be redefined in the same block, except if valid for procedure or iterator overloading purposes.</p> <h4 id="scope-rules-tuple-or-object-scope">Tuple or object scope</h4>
<p>The field identifiers inside a tuple or object definition are valid in the following places:</p> <ul class="simple">
<li>To the end of the tuple/object definition.</li> <li>Field designators of a variable of the given tuple/object type.</li> <li>In all descendant types of the object type.</li> </ul> <h4 id="scope-rules-module-scope">Module scope</h4>
<p>All identifiers of a module are valid from the point of declaration until the end of the module. Identifiers from indirectly dependent modules are <em>not</em> available. The <span id="system_1">system</span> module is automatically imported in every module.</p> <p>If a module imports an identifier by two different modules, each occurrence of the identifier has to be qualified, unless it is an overloaded procedure or iterator in which case the overloading resolution takes place:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim"># Module A
var x*: string</pre>
<pre class="listing" data-language="nim"># Module B
var x*: int</pre>
<pre class="listing" data-language="nim"># Module C
import A, B
write(stdout, x) # error: x is ambiguous
write(stdout, A.x) # no error: qualifier used

var x = 4
write(stdout, x) # not ambiguous: uses the module C's x</pre> <h4 id="scope-rules-code-reordering">Code reordering</h4>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Code reordering is experimental and must be enabled via the <code>{.experimental.}</code> pragma.</p> <p>The code reordering feature can implicitly rearrange procedure, template, and macro definitions along with variable declarations and initializations at the top level scope so that, to a large extent, a programmer should not have to worry about ordering definitions correctly or be forced to use forward declarations to preface definitions inside a module.</p> <p>Example:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">{.experimental: "codeReordering".}

proc foo(x: int) =
  bar(x)

proc bar(x: int) =
  echo(x)

foo(10)</pre>
<p>Variables can also be reordered as well. Variables that are <em>initialized</em> (i.e. variables that have their declaration and assignment combined in a single statement) can have their entire initialization statement reordered. Be wary of what code is executed at the top level:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">{.experimental: "codeReordering".}

proc a() =
  echo(foo)

var foo = 5

a() # outputs: "5"</pre>
<p>It is important to note that reordering <em>only</em> works for symbols at top level scope. Therefore, the following will <em>fail to compile:</em></p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">{.experimental: "codeReordering".}

proc a() =
  b()
  proc b() =
    echo("Hello!")

a()</pre> <h2 id="compiler-messages">Compiler Messages</h2>
<p>The Nim compiler emits different kinds of messages: <span id="hint_1">hint</span>, <span id="warning_1">warning</span>, and <span id="error_1">error</span> messages. An <em>error</em> message is emitted if the compiler encounters any static error.</p> <h2 id="pragmas">Pragmas</h2>
<p>Pragmas are Nim's method to give the compiler additional information / commands without introducing a massive number of new keywords. Pragmas are processed on the fly during semantic checking. Pragmas are enclosed in the special <code>{.</code> and <code>.}</code> curly brackets. Pragmas are also often used as a first implementation to play with a language feature before a nicer syntax to access the feature becomes available.</p> <h3 id="pragmas-deprecated-pragma">deprecated pragma</h3>
<p>The deprecated pragma is used to mark a symbol as deprecated:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc p() {.deprecated.}
var x {.deprecated.}: char</pre>
<p>This pragma can also take in an optional warning string to relay to developers.</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc thing(x: bool) {.deprecated: "use thong instead".}</pre> <h3 id="pragmas-nosideeffect-pragma">noSideEffect pragma</h3>
<p>The <code>noSideEffect</code> pragma is used to mark a proc/iterator to have no side effects. This means that the proc/iterator only changes locations that are reachable from its parameters and the return value only depends on the arguments. If none of its parameters have the type <code>var T</code> or <code>ref T</code> or <code>ptr T</code> this means no locations are modified. It is a static error to mark a proc/iterator to have no side effect if the compiler cannot verify this.</p> <p>As a special semantic rule, the built-in <a href="system#debugEcho">debugEcho</a> pretends to be free of side effects, so that it can be used for debugging routines marked as <code>noSideEffect</code>.</p> <p><code>func</code> is syntactic sugar for a proc with no side effects:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">func `+` (x, y: int): int</pre> <h3 id="pragmas-compiletime-pragma">compileTime pragma</h3>
<p>The <code>compileTime</code> pragma is used to mark a proc or variable to be used at compile time only. No code will be generated for it. Compile time procs are useful as helpers for macros. Since version 0.12.0 of the language, a proc that uses <code>system.NimNode</code> within its parameter types is implicitly declared <code>compileTime</code>:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc astHelper(n: NimNode): NimNode =
  result = n</pre>
<p>Is the same as:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc astHelper(n: NimNode): NimNode {.compileTime.} =
  result = n</pre> <h3 id="pragmas-noreturn-pragma">noReturn pragma</h3>
<p>The <code>noreturn</code> pragma is used to mark a proc that never returns.</p> <h3 id="pragmas-acyclic-pragma">acyclic pragma</h3>
<p>The <code>acyclic</code> pragma can be used for object types to mark them as acyclic even though they seem to be cyclic. This is an <strong>optimization</strong> for the garbage collector to not consider objects of this type as part of a cycle:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">type
  Node = ref NodeObj
  NodeObj {.acyclic.} = object
    left, right: Node
    data: string</pre>
<p>Or if we directly use a ref object:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">type
  Node = ref object {.acyclic.}
    left, right: Node
    data: string</pre>
<p>In the example a tree structure is declared with the <code>Node</code> type. Note that the type definition is recursive and the GC has to assume that objects of this type may form a cyclic graph. The <code>acyclic</code> pragma passes the information that this cannot happen to the GC. If the programmer uses the <code>acyclic</code> pragma for data types that are in reality cyclic, the GC may leak memory, but nothing worse happens.</p> <p><strong>Future directions</strong>: The <code>acyclic</code> pragma may become a property of a <code>ref</code> type:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">type
  Node = acyclic ref NodeObj
  NodeObj = object
    left, right: Node
    data: string</pre> <h3 id="pragmas-final-pragma">final pragma</h3>
<p>The <code>final</code> pragma can be used for an object type to specify that it cannot be inherited from. Note that inheritance is only available for objects that inherit from an existing object (via the <code>object of SuperType</code> syntax) or that have been marked as <code>inheritable</code>.</p> <h3 id="pragmas-shallow-pragma">shallow pragma</h3>
<p>The <code>shallow</code> pragma affects the semantics of a type: The compiler is allowed to make a shallow copy. This can cause serious semantic issues and break memory safety! However, it can speed up assignments considerably, because the semantics of Nim require deep copying of sequences and strings. This can be expensive, especially if sequences are used to build a tree structure:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">type
  NodeKind = enum nkLeaf, nkInner
  Node {.shallow.} = object
    case kind: NodeKind
    of nkLeaf:
      strVal: string
    of nkInner:
      children: seq[Node]</pre> <h3 id="pragmas-pure-pragma">pure pragma</h3>
<p>An object type can be marked with the <code>pure</code> pragma so that its type field which is used for runtime type identification is omitted. This used to be necessary for binary compatibility with other compiled languages.</p> <p>An enum type can be marked as <code>pure</code>. Then access of its fields always requires full qualification.</p> <h3 id="pragmas-asmnostackframe-pragma">asmNoStackFrame pragma</h3>
<p>A proc can be marked with the <code>asmNoStackFrame</code> pragma to tell the compiler it should not generate a stack frame for the proc. There are also no exit statements like <code>return result;</code> generated and the generated C function is declared as <code>__declspec(naked)</code> or <code>__attribute__((naked))</code> (depending on the used C compiler).</p> <p><strong>Note</strong>: This pragma should only be used by procs which consist solely of assembler statements.</p> <h3 id="pragmas-error-pragma">error pragma</h3>
<p>The <code>error</code> pragma is used to make the compiler output an error message with the given content. Compilation does not necessarily abort after an error though.</p> <p>The <code>error</code> pragma can also be used to annotate a symbol (like an iterator or proc). The <em>usage</em> of the symbol then triggers a compile-time error. This is especially useful to rule out that some operation is valid due to overloading and type conversions:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">## check that underlying int values are compared and not the pointers:
proc `==`(x, y: ptr int): bool {.error.}</pre> <h3 id="pragmas-fatal-pragma">fatal pragma</h3>
<p>The <code>fatal</code> pragma is used to make the compiler output an error message with the given content. In contrast to the <code>error</code> pragma, compilation is guaranteed to be aborted by this pragma. Example:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">when not defined(objc):
  {.fatal: "Compile this program with the objc command!".}</pre> <h3 id="pragmas-warning-pragma">warning pragma</h3>
<p>The <code>warning</code> pragma is used to make the compiler output a warning message with the given content. Compilation continues after the warning.</p> <h3 id="pragmas-hint-pragma">hint pragma</h3>
<p>The <code>hint</code> pragma is used to make the compiler output a hint message with the given content. Compilation continues after the hint.</p> <h3 id="pragmas-line-pragma">line pragma</h3>
<p>The <code>line</code> pragma can be used to affect line information of the annotated statement as seen in stack backtraces:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">template myassert*(cond: untyped, msg = "") =
  if not cond:
    # change run-time line information of the 'raise' statement:
    {.line: InstantiationInfo().}:
      raise newException(EAssertionFailed, msg)</pre>
<p>If the <code>line</code> pragma is used with a parameter, the parameter needs be a <code>tuple[filename: string, line: int]</code>. If it is used without a parameter, <code>system.InstantiationInfo()</code> is used.</p> <h3 id="pragmas-linearscanend-pragma">linearScanEnd pragma</h3>
<p>The <code>linearScanEnd</code> pragma can be used to tell the compiler how to compile a Nim <span id="case_1">case</span> statement. Syntactically it has to be used as a statement:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">case myInt
of 0:
  echo "most common case"
of 1:
  {.linearScanEnd.}
  echo "second most common case"
of 2: echo "unlikely: use branch table"
else: echo "unlikely too: use branch table for ", myInt</pre>
<p>In the example, the case branches <code>0</code> and <code>1</code> are much more common than the other cases. Therefore the generated assembler code should test for these values first, so that the CPU's branch predictor has a good chance to succeed (avoiding an expensive CPU pipeline stall). The other cases might be put into a jump table for O(1) overhead, but at the cost of a (very likely) pipeline stall.</p> <p>The <code>linearScanEnd</code> pragma should be put into the last branch that should be tested against via linear scanning. If put into the last branch of the whole <code>case</code> statement, the whole <code>case</code> statement uses linear scanning.</p> <h3 id="pragmas-computedgoto-pragma">computedGoto pragma</h3>
<p>The <code>computedGoto</code> pragma can be used to tell the compiler how to compile a Nim <span id="case_2">case</span> in a <code>while true</code> statement. Syntactically it has to be used as a statement inside the loop:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">type
  MyEnum = enum
    enumA, enumB, enumC, enumD, enumE

proc vm() =
  var instructions: array[0..100, MyEnum]
  instructions[2] = enumC
  instructions[3] = enumD
  instructions[4] = enumA
  instructions[5] = enumD
  instructions[6] = enumC
  instructions[7] = enumA
  instructions[8] = enumB
  
  instructions[12] = enumE
  var pc = 0
  while true:
    {.computedGoto.}
    let instr = instructions[pc]
    case instr
    of enumA:
      echo "yeah A"
    of enumC, enumD:
      echo "yeah CD"
    of enumB:
      echo "yeah B"
    of enumE:
      break
    inc(pc)

vm()</pre>
<p>As the example shows <code>computedGoto</code> is mostly useful for interpreters. If the underlying backend (C compiler) does not support the computed goto extension the pragma is simply ignored.</p> <h3 id="pragmas-unroll-pragma">unroll pragma</h3>
<p>The <code>unroll</code> pragma can be used to tell the compiler that it should unroll a <span id="for_2">for</span> or <span id="while_1">while</span> loop for runtime efficiency:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc searchChar(s: string, c: char): int =
  for i in 0 .. s.high:
    {.unroll: 4.}
    if s[i] == c: return i
  result = -1</pre>
<p>In the above example, the search loop is unrolled by a factor 4. The unroll factor can be left out too; the compiler then chooses an appropriate unroll factor.</p> <p><strong>Note</strong>: Currently the compiler recognizes but ignores this pragma.</p> <h3 id="pragmas-immediate-pragma">immediate pragma</h3>
<p>The immediate pragma is obsolete. See <a href="#typed-vs-untyped-parameters">Typed vs untyped parameters</a>.</p> <h3 id="pragmas-compilation-option-pragmas">compilation option pragmas</h3>
<p>The listed pragmas here can be used to override the code generation options for a proc/method/converter.</p> <p>The implementation currently provides the following possible options (various others may be added later).</p> <table>

<p>Example:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">{.checks: off, optimization: speed.}
# compile without runtime checks and optimize for speed</pre> <h3 id="pragmas-push-and-pop-pragmas">push and pop pragmas</h3>
<p>The <span id="pushslashpop_1">push/pop</span> pragmas are very similar to the option directive, but are used to override the settings temporarily. Example:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">{.push checks: off.}
# compile this section without runtime checks as it is
# speed critical
# ... some code ...
{.pop.} # restore old settings</pre> <h3 id="pragmas-register-pragma">register pragma</h3>
<p>The <code>register</code> pragma is for variables only. It declares the variable as <code>register</code>, giving the compiler a hint that the variable should be placed in a hardware register for faster access. C compilers usually ignore this though and for good reasons: Often they do a better job without it anyway.</p> <p>In highly specific cases (a dispatch loop of a bytecode interpreter for example) it may provide benefits, though.</p> <h3 id="pragmas-global-pragma">global pragma</h3>
<p>The <code>global</code> pragma can be applied to a variable within a proc to instruct the compiler to store it in a global location and initialize it once at program startup.</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc isHexNumber(s: string): bool =
  var pattern {.global.} = re"[0-9a-fA-F]+"
  result = s.match(pattern)</pre>
<p>When used within a generic proc, a separate unique global variable will be created for each instantiation of the proc. The order of initialization of the created global variables within a module is not defined, but all of them will be initialized after any top-level variables in their originating module and before any variable in a module that imports it.</p> <h3 id="pragmas-pragma-pragma">pragma pragma</h3>
<p>The <code>pragma</code> pragma can be used to declare user defined pragmas. This is useful because Nim's templates and macros do not affect pragmas. User defined pragmas are in a different module-wide scope than all other symbols. They cannot be imported from a module.</p> <p>Example:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">when appType == "lib":
  {.pragma: rtl, exportc, dynlib, cdecl.}
else:
  {.pragma: rtl, importc, dynlib: "client.dll", cdecl.}

proc p*(a, b: int): int {.rtl.} =
  result = a+b</pre>
<p>In the example a new pragma named <code>rtl</code> is introduced that either imports a symbol from a dynamic library or exports the symbol for dynamic library generation.</p> <h3 id="pragmas-disabling-certain-messages">Disabling certain messages</h3>
<p>Nim generates some warnings and hints ("line too long") that may annoy the user. A mechanism for disabling certain messages is provided: Each hint and warning message contains a symbol in brackets. This is the message's identifier that can be used to enable or disable it:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">{.hint[LineTooLong]: off.} # turn off the hint about too long lines</pre>
<p>This is often better than disabling all warnings at once.</p> <h3 id="pragmas-used-pragma">used pragma</h3>
<p>Nim produces a warning for symbols that are not exported and not used either. The <code>used</code> pragma can be attached to a symbol to suppress this warning. This is particularly useful when the symbol was generated by a macro:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">template implementArithOps(T) =
  proc echoAdd(a, b: T) {.used.} =
    echo a + b
  proc echoSub(a, b: T) {.used.} =
    echo a - b

# no warning produced for the unused 'echoSub'
implementArithOps(int)
echoAdd 3, 5</pre> <h3 id="pragmas-experimental-pragma">experimental pragma</h3>
<p>The <code>experimental</code> pragma enables experimental language features. Depending on the concrete feature this means that the feature is either considered too unstable for an otherwise stable release or that the future of the feature is uncertain (it may be removed any time).</p> <p>Example:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">{.experimental: "parallel".}

proc useParallel() =
  parallel:
    for i in 0..4:
      echo "echo in parallel"</pre>
<p>As a top level statement, the experimental pragma enables a feature for the rest of the module it's enabled in. This is problematic for macro and generic instantiations that cross a module scope. Currently these usages have to be put into a <code>.push/pop</code> environment:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim"># client.nim
proc useParallel*[T](unused: T) =
  # use a generic T here to show the problem.
  {.push experimental: "parallel".}
  parallel:
    for i in 0..4:
      echo "echo in parallel"
  
  {.pop.}</pre>
<pre class="listing" data-language="nim">import client
useParallel(1)</pre> <h2 id="implementation-specific-pragmas">Implementation Specific Pragmas</h2>
<p>This section describes additional pragmas that the current Nim implementation supports but which should not be seen as part of the language specification.</p> <h3 id="implementation-specific-pragmas-bitsize-pragma">Bitsize pragma</h3>
<p>The <code>bitsize</code> pragma is for object field members. It declares the field as a bitfield in C/C++.</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">type
  mybitfield = object
    flag {.bitsize:1.}: cuint</pre>
<p>generates:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">struct mybitfield {
  unsigned int flag:1;
};</pre> <h3 id="implementation-specific-pragmas-volatile-pragma">Volatile pragma</h3>
<p>The <code>volatile</code> pragma is for variables only. It declares the variable as <code>volatile</code>, whatever that means in C/C++ (its semantics are not well defined in C/C++).</p> <p><strong>Note</strong>: This pragma will not exist for the LLVM backend.</p> <h3 id="implementation-specific-pragmas-nodecl-pragma">NoDecl pragma</h3>
<p>The <code>noDecl</code> pragma can be applied to almost any symbol (variable, proc, type, etc.) and is sometimes useful for interoperability with C: It tells Nim that it should not generate a declaration for the symbol in the C code. For example:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">var
  EACCES {.importc, noDecl.}: cint # pretend EACCES was a variable, as
                                   # Nim does not know its value</pre>
<p>However, the <code>header</code> pragma is often the better alternative.</p> <p><strong>Note</strong>: This will not work for the LLVM backend.</p> <h3 id="implementation-specific-pragmas-header-pragma">Header pragma</h3>
<p>The <code>header</code> pragma is very similar to the <code>noDecl</code> pragma: It can be applied to almost any symbol and specifies that it should not be declared and instead the generated code should contain an <code>#include</code>:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">type
  PFile {.importc: "FILE*", header: "&lt;stdio.h&gt;".} = distinct pointer
    # import C's FILE* type; Nim will treat it as a new pointer type</pre>
<p>The <code>header</code> pragma always expects a string constant. The string contant contains the header file: As usual for C, a system header file is enclosed in angle brackets: <code>&lt;&gt;</code>. If no angle brackets are given, Nim encloses the header file in <code>""</code> in the generated C code.</p> <p><strong>Note</strong>: This will not work for the LLVM backend.</p> <h3 id="implementation-specific-pragmas-incompletestruct-pragma">IncompleteStruct pragma</h3>
<p>The <code>incompleteStruct</code> pragma tells the compiler to not use the underlying C <code>struct</code> in a <code>sizeof</code> expression:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">type

<p>The <code>compile</code> pragma can be used to compile and link a C/C++ source file with the project:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">{.compile: "myfile.cpp".}</pre>

<p>The <code>emit</code> pragma can be used to directly affect the output of the compiler's code generator. So it makes your code unportable to other code generators/backends.

<p>The compiler needs to be told to generate C++ (command <code>cpp</code>) for this to work. The conditional symbol <code>cpp</code> is defined when the compiler emits C++ code.</p> <h4 id="importcpp-pragma-namespaces">Namespaces</h4>
<p>The <em>sloppy interfacing</em> example uses <code>.emit</code> to produce <code>using namespace</code> declarations. It is usually much better to instead refer to the imported name via the <code>namespace::identifier</code> notation:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">type

<p>When <code>importcpp</code> is applied to an enum type the numerical enum values are annotated with the C++ enum type, like in this example: <code>((TheCppEnum)(3))</code>. (This turned out to be the simplest way to implement it.)</p> <h4 id="importcpp-pragma-importcpp-for-procs">Importcpp for procs</h4>
<p>Note that the <code>importcpp</code> variant for procs uses a somewhat cryptic pattern language for maximum flexibility:</p> <ul class="simple">
<li>A hash <code>#</code> symbol is replaced by the first or next argument.</li> <li>A dot following the hash <code>#.</code> indicates that the call should use C++'s dot or arrow notation.</li> <li>An at symbol <code>@</code> is replaced by the remaining arguments, separated by commas.</li> </ul> <p>For example:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc cppMethod(this: CppObj, a, b, c: cint) {.importcpp: "#.CppMethod(@)".}
var x: ptr CppObj
cppMethod(x[], 1, 2, 3)</pre>
<p>Produces:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">x-&gt;CppMethod(1, 2, 3)</pre>
<p>As a special rule to keep backwards compatibility with older versions of the <code>importcpp</code> pragma, if there is no special pattern character (any of <code># ' @</code>) at all, C++'s dot or arrow notation is assumed, so the above example can also be written as:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc cppMethod(this: CppObj, a, b, c: cint) {.importcpp: "CppMethod".}</pre>
<p>Note that the pattern language naturally also covers C++'s operator overloading capabilities:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc vectorAddition(a, b: Vec3): Vec3 {.importcpp: "# + #".}
proc dictLookup(a: Dict, k: Key): Value {.importcpp: "#[#]".}</pre>

<li>An apostrophe <code>'</code> followed by an integer <code>i</code> in the range 0..9 is replaced by the i'th parameter <em>type</em>. The 0th position is the result type. This can be used to pass types to C++ function templates. Between the <code>'</code> and the digit an asterisk can be used to get to the base type of the type. (So it "takes away a star" from the type; <code>T*</code> becomes <code>T</code>.) Two stars can be used to get to the element type of the element type etc.</li> </ul> <p>For example:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">type Input {.importcpp: "System::Input".} = object

<code>#@</code> is a special case to support a <code>cnew</code> operation. It is required so that the call expression is inlined directly, without going through a temporary location.

<p>Sometimes a C++ class has a private copy constructor and so code like <code>Class c = Class(1,2);</code> must not be generated but instead <code>Class c(1,2);</code>. For this purpose the Nim proc that wraps a C++ constructor needs to be annotated with the <span id="constructor_1">constructor</span> pragma. This pragma also helps to generate faster C++ code since construction then doesn't invoke the copy constructor:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim"># a better constructor of 'Foo':
proc constructFoo(a, b: cint): Foo {.importcpp: "Foo(@)", constructor.}</pre> <h4 id="importcpp-pragma-wrapping-destructors">Wrapping destructors</h4>
<p>Since Nim generates C++ directly, any destructor is called implicitly by the C++ compiler at the scope exits. This means that often one can get away with not wrapping the destructor at all! However when it needs to be invoked explicitly, it needs to be wrapped. The pattern language provides everything that is required:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc destroyFoo(this: var Foo) {.importcpp: "#.~Foo()".}</pre> <h4 id="importcpp-pragma-importcpp-for-objects">Importcpp for objects</h4>

<p>It is possible to define custom typed pragmas. Custom pragmas do not effect code generation directly, but their presence can be detected by macros. Custom pragmas are defined using templates annotated with pragma <code>pragma</code>:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">template dbTable(name: string, table_space: string = "") {.pragma.}
template dbKey(name: string = "", primary_key: bool = false) {.pragma.}
template dbForeignKey(t: type) {.pragma.}
template dbIgnore {.pragma.}</pre>
<p>Consider stylized example of possible Object Relation Mapping (ORM) implementation:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">const tblspace {.strdefine.} = "dev" # switch for dev, test and prod environments

type
  User {.dbTable("users", tblspace).} = object

    is_cached {.dbIgnore.}: bool

    user_id {.dbForeignKey: User.}: int
    read_access: bool
    write_access: bool
    admin_acess: bool</pre>
<p>In this example custom pragmas are used to describe how Nim objects are mapped to the schema of the relational database. Custom pragmas can have zero or more arguments. In order to pass multiple arguments use one of template call syntaxes. All arguments are typed and follow standard overload resolution rules for templates. Therefore, it is possible to have default values for arguments, pass by name, varargs, etc.</p> <p>Custom pragmas can be used in all locations where ordinary pragmas can be specified. It is possible to annotate procs, templates, type and variable definitions, statements, etc.</p> <p>Macros module includes helpers which can be used to simplify custom pragma access <em>hasCustomPragma</em>, <em>getCustomPragmaVal</em>. Please consult macros module documentation for details.

<p>Note that this pragma is somewhat of a misnomer: Other backends do provide the same feature under the same name. Also, if one is interfacing with C++ the <a href="manual#implementation-specific-pragmas-importcpp-pragma">ImportCpp pragma</a> and interfacing with Objective-C the <a href="manual#implementation-specific-pragmas-importobjc-pragma">ImportObjC pragma</a> can be used.</p> <p>The string literal passed to <code>importc</code> can be a format string:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc p(s: cstring) {.importc: "prefix$1".}</pre>

<p>The <code>exportc</code> pragma provides a means to export a type, a variable, or a procedure to C. Enums and constants can't be exported. The optional argument is a string containing the C identifier. If the argument is missing, the C name is the Nim identifier <em>exactly as spelled</em>:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc callme(formatstr: cstring) {.exportc: "callMe", varargs.}</pre>
<p>Note that this pragma is somewhat of a misnomer: Other backends do provide the same feature under the same name.</p> <p>The string literal passed to <code>exportc</code> can be a format string:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc p(s: string) {.exportc: "prefix$1".} =

<p>In the example the external name of <code>p</code> is set to <code>prefixp</code>. Only <code>$1</code> is available and a literal dollar sign must be written as <code>$$</code>.</p> <h3 id="foreign-function-interface-extern-pragma">Extern pragma</h3>
<p>Like <code>exportc</code> or <code>importc</code>, the <code>extern</code> pragma affects name mangling. The string literal passed to <code>extern</code> can be a format string:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc p(s: string) {.extern: "prefix$1".} =
  echo s</pre>
<p>In the example the external name of <code>p</code> is set to <code>prefixp</code>. Only <code>$1</code> is available and a literal dollar sign must be written as <code>$$</code>.</p> <h3 id="foreign-function-interface-bycopy-pragma">Bycopy pragma</h3>
<p>The <code>bycopy</code> pragma can be applied to an object or tuple type and instructs the compiler to pass the type by value to procs:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">type
  Vector {.bycopy.} = object
    x, y, z: float</pre> <h3 id="foreign-function-interface-byref-pragma">Byref pragma</h3>
<p>The <code>byref</code> pragma can be applied to an object or tuple type and instructs the compiler to pass the type by reference (hidden pointer) to procs.</p> <h3 id="foreign-function-interface-varargs-pragma">Varargs pragma</h3>
<p>The <code>varargs</code> pragma can be applied to procedures only (and procedure types). It tells Nim that the proc can take a variable number of parameters after the last specified parameter. Nim string values will be converted to C strings automatically:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc printf(formatstr: cstring) {.nodecl, varargs.}

printf("hallo %s", "world") # "world" will be passed as C string</pre> <h3 id="foreign-function-interface-union-pragma">Union pragma</h3>
<p>The <code>union</code> pragma can be applied to any <code>object</code> type. It means all of the object's fields are overlaid in memory. This produces a <code>union</code> instead of a <code>struct</code> in the generated C/C++ code. The object declaration then must not use inheritance or any GC'ed memory but this is currently not checked.</p> <p><strong>Future directions</strong>: GC'ed memory should be allowed in unions and the GC should scan unions conservatively.</p> <h3 id="foreign-function-interface-packed-pragma">Packed pragma</h3>
<p>The <code>packed</code> pragma can be applied to any <code>object</code> type. It ensures that the fields of an object are packed back-to-back in memory. It is useful to store packets or messages from/to network or hardware drivers, and for interoperability with C. Combining packed pragma with inheritance is not defined, and it should not be used with GC'ed memory (ref's).</p> <p><strong>Future directions</strong>: Using GC'ed memory in packed pragma will result in compile-time error. Usage with inheritance should be defined and documented.</p> <h3 id="foreign-function-interface-unchecked-pragma">Unchecked pragma</h3>
<p>The <code>unchecked</code> pragma can be used to mark a named array as <code>unchecked</code> meaning its bounds are not checked. This is often useful to implement customized flexibly sized arrays. Additionally an unchecked array is translated into a C array of undetermined size:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">type
  ArrayPart{.unchecked.} = array[0, int]
  MySeq = object
    len, cap: int
    data: ArrayPart</pre>
<p>Produces roughly this C code:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">typedef struct {
  NI len;
  NI cap;
  NI data[];
} MySeq;</pre>
<p>The base type of the unchecked array may not contain any GC'ed memory but this is currently not checked.</p> <p><strong>Future directions</strong>: GC'ed memory should be allowed in unchecked arrays and there should be an explicit annotation of how the GC is to determine the runtime size of the array.</p> <h3 id="foreign-function-interface-dynlib-pragma-for-import">Dynlib pragma for import</h3>
<p>With the <code>dynlib</code> pragma a procedure or a variable can be imported from a dynamic library (<code>.dll</code> files for Windows, <code>lib*.so</code> files for UNIX). The non-optional argument has to be the name of the dynamic library:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc gtk_image_new(): PGtkWidget
  {.cdecl, dynlib: "libgtk-x11-2.0.so", importc.}</pre>
<p>In general, importing a dynamic library does not require any special linker options or linking with import libraries. This also implies that no <em>devel</em> packages need to be installed.</p> <p>The <code>dynlib</code> import mechanism supports a versioning scheme:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc Tcl_Eval(interp: pTcl_Interp, script: cstring): int {.cdecl,
  importc, dynlib: "libtcl(|8.5|8.4|8.3).so.(1|0)".}</pre>
<p>At runtime the dynamic library is searched for (in this order):</p>
<pre data-language="nim">libtcl.so.1
libtcl.so.0
libtcl8.5.so.1
libtcl8.5.so.0
libtcl8.4.so.1
libtcl8.4.so.0
libtcl8.3.so.1
libtcl8.3.so.0</pre> <p>The <code>dynlib</code> pragma supports not only constant strings as argument but also string expressions in general:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">import os

proc getDllName: string =
  result = "mylib.dll"
  if existsFile(result): return
  result = "mylib2.dll"
  if existsFile(result): return
  quit("could not load dynamic library")

proc myImport(s: cstring) {.cdecl, importc, dynlib: getDllName().}</pre>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Patterns like <code>libtcl(|8.5|8.4).so</code> are only supported in constant strings, because they are precompiled.</p> <p><strong>Note</strong>: Passing variables to the <code>dynlib</code> pragma will fail at runtime because of order of initialization problems.</p> <p><strong>Note</strong>: A <code>dynlib</code> import can be overridden with the <code>--dynlibOverride:name</code> command line option. The Compiler User Guide contains further information.</p> <h3 id="foreign-function-interface-dynlib-pragma-for-export">Dynlib pragma for export</h3>
<p>With the <code>dynlib</code> pragma a procedure can also be exported to a dynamic library. The pragma then has no argument and has to be used in conjunction with the <code>exportc</code> pragma:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc exportme(): int {.cdecl, exportc, dynlib.}</pre>
<p>This is only useful if the program is compiled as a dynamic library via the <code>--app:lib</code> command line option. This pragma only has an effect for the code generation on the Windows target, so when this pragma is forgotten and the dynamic library is only tested on Mac and/or Linux, there won't be an error. On Windows this pragma adds <code>__declspec(dllexport)</code> to the function declaration.</p> <h2 id="threads">Threads</h2>
<p>To enable thread support the <code>--threads:on</code> command line switch needs to be used. The <code>system</code> module then contains several threading primitives. See the <a href="threads">threads</a> and <a href="channels">channels</a> modules for the low level thread API. There are also high level parallelism constructs available. See <a href="#parallel-spawn">spawn</a> for further details.</p> <p>Nim's memory model for threads is quite different than that of other common programming languages (C, Pascal, Java): Each thread has its own (garbage collected) heap and sharing of memory is restricted to global variables. This helps to prevent race conditions. GC efficiency is improved quite a lot, because the GC never has to stop other threads and see what they reference. Memory allocation requires no lock at all! This design easily scales to massive multicore processors that are becoming the norm.</p> <h3 id="threads-thread-pragma">Thread pragma</h3>
<p>A proc that is executed as a new thread of execution should be marked by the <code>thread</code> pragma for reasons of readability. The compiler checks for violations of the <span id="no-heap-sharing-restriction_1">no heap sharing restriction</span>: This restriction implies that it is invalid to construct a data structure that consists of memory allocated from different (thread local) heaps.</p> <p>A thread proc is passed to <code>createThread</code> or <code>spawn</code> and invoked indirectly; so the <code>thread</code> pragma implies <code>procvar</code>.</p> <h3 id="threads-gc-safety">GC safety</h3>
<p>We call a proc <code>p</code> <span id="gc-safe_1">GC safe</span> when it doesn't access any global variable that contains GC'ed memory (<code>string</code>, <code>seq</code>, <code>ref</code> or a closure) either directly or indirectly through a call to a GC unsafe proc.</p> <p>The <span id="gcsafe_1">gcsafe</span> annotation can be used to mark a proc to be gcsafe, otherwise this property is inferred by the compiler. Note that <code>noSideEffect</code> implies <code>gcsafe</code>. The only way to create a thread is via <code>spawn</code> or <code>createThread</code>. <code>spawn</code> is usually the preferable method. Either way the invoked proc must not use <code>var</code> parameters nor must any of its parameters contain a <code>ref</code> or <code>closure</code> type. This enforces the <em>no heap sharing restriction</em>.</p> <p>Routines that are imported from C are always assumed to be <code>gcsafe</code>. To disable the GC-safety checking the <code>--threadAnalysis:off</code> command line switch can be used. This is a temporary workaround to ease the porting effort from old code to the new threading model.</p> <p>To override the compiler's gcsafety analysis a <code>{.gcsafe.}</code> pragma block can be used:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">var
  someGlobal: string = "some string here"
  perThread {.threadvar.}: string

proc setPerThread() =
  {.gcsafe.}:
    deepCopy(perThread, someGlobal)</pre>
<p>Future directions:</p> <ul class="simple">
<li>A shared GC'ed heap might be provided.</li> </ul> <h3 id="threads-threadvar-pragma">Threadvar pragma</h3>
<p>A variable can be marked with the <code>threadvar</code> pragma, which makes it a <span id="threadminuslocal_1">thread-local</span> variable; Additionally, this implies all the effects of the <code>global</code> pragma.</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">var checkpoints* {.threadvar.}: seq[string]</pre>
<p>Due to implementation restrictions thread local variables cannot be initialized within the <code>var</code> section. (Every thread local variable needs to be replicated at thread creation.)</p> <h3 id="threads-threads-and-exceptions">Threads and exceptions</h3>
<p>The interaction between threads and exceptions is simple: A <em>handled</em> exception in one thread cannot affect any other thread. However, an <em>unhandled</em> exception in one thread terminates the whole <em>process</em>!</p> <h2 id="parallel-amp-spawn">Parallel &amp; Spawn</h2>
<p>Nim has two flavors of parallelism:</p> <ol class="simple">
<li>
<span id="structured_1">Structured</span> parallelism via the <code>parallel</code> statement.</li> <li>
<span id="unstructured_1">Unstructured</span> parallelism via the standalone <code>spawn</code> statement.</li> </ol> <p>Nim has a builtin thread pool that can be used for CPU intensive tasks. For IO intensive tasks the <code>async</code> and <code>await</code> features should be used instead. Both parallel and spawn need the <a href="threadpool">threadpool</a> module to work.</p> <p>Somewhat confusingly, <code>spawn</code> is also used in the <code>parallel</code> statement with slightly different semantics. <code>spawn</code> always takes a call expression of the form <code>f(a, ...)</code>. Let <code>T</code> be <code>f</code>'s return type. If <code>T</code> is <code>void</code> then <code>spawn</code>'s return type is also <code>void</code> otherwise it is <code>FlowVar[T]</code>.</p> <p>Within a <code>parallel</code> section sometimes the <code>FlowVar[T]</code> is eliminated to <code>T</code>. This happens when <code>T</code> does not contain any GC'ed memory. The compiler can ensure the location in <code>location = spawn f(...)</code> is not read prematurely within a <code>parallel</code> section and so there is no need for the overhead of an indirection via <code>FlowVar[T]</code> to ensure correctness.</p> <p><strong>Note</strong>: Currently exceptions are not propagated between <code>spawn</code>'ed tasks!</p> <h3 id="parallel-amp-spawn-spawn-statement">Spawn statement</h3>
<p><span id="spawn_1">spawn</span> can be used to pass a task to the thread pool:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">import threadpool

proc processLine(line: string) =
  discard "do some heavy lifting here"

for x in lines("myinput.txt"):
  spawn processLine(x)
sync()</pre>
<p>For reasons of type safety and implementation simplicity the expression that <code>spawn</code> takes is restricted:</p> <ul class="simple">
<li>It must be a call expression <code>f(a, ...)</code>.</li> <li>
<code>f</code> must be <code>gcsafe</code>.</li> <li>
<code>f</code> must not have the calling convention <code>closure</code>.</li> <li>
<code>f</code>'s parameters may not be of type <code>var</code>. This means one has to use raw <code>ptr</code>'s for data passing reminding the programmer to be careful.</li> <li>
<code>ref</code> parameters are deeply copied which is a subtle semantic change and can cause performance problems but ensures memory safety. This deep copy is performed via <code>system.deepCopy</code> and so can be overridden.</li> <li>For <em>safe</em> data exchange between <code>f</code> and the caller a global <code>TChannel</code> needs to be used. However, since spawn can return a result, often no further communication is required.</li> </ul> <p><code>spawn</code> executes the passed expression on the thread pool and returns a <span id="data-flow-variable_1">data flow variable</span> <code>FlowVar[T]</code> that can be read from. The reading with the <code>^</code> operator is <strong>blocking</strong>. However, one can use <code>blockUntilAny</code> to wait on multiple flow variables at the same time:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">import threadpool, ...

# wait until 2 out of 3 servers received the update:
proc main =
  var responses = newSeq[FlowVarBase](3)
  for i in 0..2:
    responses[i] = spawn tellServer(Update, "key", "value")
  var index = blockUntilAny(responses)
  assert index &gt;= 0
  responses.del(index)
  discard blockUntilAny(responses)</pre>
<p>Data flow variables ensure that no data races are possible. Due to technical limitations not every type <code>T</code> is possible in a data flow variable: <code>T</code> has to be of the type <code>ref</code>, <code>string</code>, <code>seq</code> or of a type that doesn't contain a type that is garbage collected. This restriction is not hard to work-around in practice.</p> <h3 id="parallel-amp-spawn-parallel-statement">Parallel statement</h3>
<p>Example:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim"># Compute PI in an inefficient way
import strutils, math, threadpool
{.experimental: "parallel".}

proc term(k: float): float = 4 * math.pow(-1, k) / (2*k + 1)

proc pi(n: int): float =
  var ch = newSeq[float](n+1)
  parallel:
    for k in 0..ch.high:
      ch[k] = spawn term(float(k))
  for k in 0..ch.high:
    result += ch[k]

echo formatFloat(pi(5000))</pre>
<p>The parallel statement is the preferred mechanism to introduce parallelism in a Nim program. A subset of the Nim language is valid within a <code>parallel</code> section. This subset is checked to be free of data races at compile time. A sophisticated <span id="disjoint-checker_1">disjoint checker</span> ensures that no data races are possible even though shared memory is extensively supported!</p> <p>The subset is in fact the full language with the following restrictions / changes:</p> <ul class="simple">
<li>
<code>spawn</code> within a <code>parallel</code> section has special semantics.</li> <li>Every location of the form <code>a[i]</code> and <code>a[i..j]</code> and <code>dest</code> where <code>dest</code> is part of the pattern <code>dest = spawn f(...)</code> has to be provably disjoint. This is called the <em>disjoint check</em>.</li> <li>Every other complex location <code>loc</code> that is used in a spawned proc (<code>spawn f(loc)</code>) has to be immutable for the duration of the <code>parallel</code> section. This is called the <em>immutability check</em>. Currently it is not specified what exactly "complex location" means. We need to make this an optimization!</li> <li>Every array access has to be provably within bounds. This is called the <em>bounds check</em>.</li> <li>Slices are optimized so that no copy is performed. This optimization is not yet performed for ordinary slices outside of a <code>parallel</code> section.</li> </ul> <h2 id="guards-and-locks">Guards and locks</h2>
<p>Apart from <code>spawn</code> and <code>parallel</code> Nim also provides all the common low level concurrency mechanisms like locks, atomic intrinsics or condition variables.</p> <p>Nim significantly improves on the safety of these features via additional pragmas:</p> <ol class="simple">
<li>A <span id="guard_1">guard</span> annotation is introduced to prevent data races.</li> <li>Every access of a guarded memory location needs to happen in an appropriate <span id="locks_1">locks</span> statement.</li> <li>Locks and routines can be annotated with <span id="lock-levels_1">lock levels</span> to prevent deadlocks at compile time.</li> </ol> <h3 id="guards-and-locks-guards-and-the-locks-section">Guards and the locks section</h3> <h4 id="guards-and-the-locks-section-protecting-global-variables">Protecting global variables</h4>
<p>Object fields and global variables can be annotated via a <code>guard</code> pragma:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">var glock: TLock
var gdata {.guard: glock.}: int</pre>
<p>The compiler then ensures that every access of <code>gdata</code> is within a <code>locks</code> section:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc invalid =
  # invalid: unguarded access:
  echo gdata

proc valid =
  # valid access:
  {.locks: [glock].}:
    echo gdata</pre>
<p>Top level accesses to <code>gdata</code> are always allowed so that it can be initialized conveniently. It is <em>assumed</em> (but not enforced) that every top level statement is executed before any concurrent action happens.</p> <p>The <code>locks</code> section deliberately looks ugly because it has no runtime semantics and should not be used directly! It should only be used in templates that also implement some form of locking at runtime:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">template lock(a: TLock; body: untyped) =
  pthread_mutex_lock(a)
  {.locks: [a].}:
    try:
      body
    finally:
      pthread_mutex_unlock(a)</pre>
<p>The guard does not need to be of any particular type. It is flexible enough to model low level lockfree mechanisms:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">var dummyLock {.compileTime.}: int
var atomicCounter {.guard: dummyLock.}: int

template atomicRead(x): untyped =
  {.locks: [dummyLock].}:
    memoryReadBarrier()
    x

echo atomicRead(atomicCounter)</pre>
<p>The <code>locks</code> pragma takes a list of lock expressions <code>locks: [a, b, ...]</code> in order to support <em>multi lock</em> statements. Why these are essential is explained in the <a href="#guards-and-locks-lock-levels">lock levels</a> section.</p> <h4 id="guards-and-the-locks-section-protecting-general-locations">Protecting general locations</h4>
<p>The <code>guard</code> annotation can also be used to protect fields within an object. The guard then needs to be another field within the same object or a global variable.</p> <p>Since objects can reside on the heap or on the stack this greatly enhances the expressivity of the language:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">type
  ProtectedCounter = object
    v {.guard: L.}: int
    L: TLock

proc incCounters(counters: var openArray[ProtectedCounter]) =
  for i in 0..counters.high:
    lock counters[i].L:
      inc counters[i].v</pre>
<p>The access to field <code>x.v</code> is allowed since its guard <code>x.L</code> is active. After template expansion, this amounts to:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc incCounters(counters: var openArray[ProtectedCounter]) =
  for i in 0..counters.high:
    pthread_mutex_lock(counters[i].L)
    {.locks: [counters[i].L].}:
      try:
        inc counters[i].v
      finally:
        pthread_mutex_unlock(counters[i].L)</pre>
<p>There is an analysis that checks that <code>counters[i].L</code> is the lock that corresponds to the protected location <code>counters[i].v</code>. This analysis is called <span id="path-analysis_1">path analysis</span> because it deals with paths to locations like <code>obj.field[i].fieldB[j]</code>.</p> <p>The path analysis is <strong>currently unsound</strong>, but that doesn't make it useless. Two paths are considered equivalent if they are syntactically the same.</p> <p>This means the following compiles (for now) even though it really should not:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">{.locks: [a[i].L].}:
  inc i
  access a[i].v</pre> <h3 id="guards-and-locks-lock-levels">Lock levels</h3>
<p>Lock levels are used to enforce a global locking order in order to prevent deadlocks at compile-time. A lock level is an constant integer in the range 0..1_000. Lock level 0 means that no lock is acquired at all.</p> <p>If a section of code holds a lock of level <code>M</code> than it can also acquire any lock of level <code>N &lt; M</code>. Another lock of level <code>M</code> cannot be acquired. Locks of the same level can only be acquired <em>at the same time</em> within a single <code>locks</code> section:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">var a, b: TLock[2]
var x: TLock[1]
# invalid locking order: TLock[1] cannot be acquired before TLock[2]:
{.locks: [x].}:
  {.locks: [a].}:
    ...
# valid locking order: TLock[2] acquired before TLock[1]:
{.locks: [a].}:
  {.locks: [x].}:
    ...

# invalid locking order: TLock[2] acquired before TLock[2]:
{.locks: [a].}:
  {.locks: [b].}:
    ...

# valid locking order, locks of the same level acquired at the same time:
{.locks: [a, b].}:
  ...</pre>
<p>Here is how a typical multilock statement can be implemented in Nim. Note how the runtime check is required to ensure a global ordering for two locks <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> of the same lock level:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">template multilock(a, b: ptr TLock; body: untyped) =
  if cast[ByteAddress](a) &lt; cast[ByteAddress](b):
    pthread_mutex_lock(a)
    pthread_mutex_lock(b)
  else:
    pthread_mutex_lock(b)
    pthread_mutex_lock(a)
  {.locks: [a, b].}:
    try:
      body
    finally:
      pthread_mutex_unlock(a)
      pthread_mutex_unlock(b)</pre>
<p>Whole routines can also be annotated with a <code>locks</code> pragma that takes a lock level. This then means that the routine may acquire locks of up to this level. This is essential so that procs can be called within a <code>locks</code> section:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">proc p() {.locks: 3.} = discard

var a: TLock[4]
{.locks: [a].}:
  # p's locklevel (3) is strictly less than a's (4) so the call is allowed:
  p()</pre>
<p>As usual <code>locks</code> is an inferred effect and there is a subtype relation: <code>proc () {.locks: N.}</code> is a subtype of <code>proc () {.locks: M.}</code> iff (M &lt;= N).</p> <p>The <code>locks</code> pragma can also take the special value <code>"unknown"</code>. This is useful in the context of dynamic method dispatching. In the following example, the compiler can infer a lock level of 0 for the <code>base</code> case. However, one of the overloaded methods calls a procvar which is potentially locking. Thus, the lock level of calling <code>g.testMethod</code> cannot be inferred statically, leading to compiler warnings. By using <code>{.locks: "unknown".}</code>, the base method can be marked explicitly as having unknown lock level as well:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">type SomeBase* = ref object of RootObj
type SomeDerived* = ref object of SomeBase
  memberProc*: proc ()

method testMethod(g: SomeBase) {.base, locks: "unknown".} = discard
method testMethod(g: SomeDerived) =
  if g.memberProc != nil:
    g.memberProc()</pre> <h2 id="taint-mode">Taint mode</h2>
<p>The Nim compiler and most parts of the standard library support a taint mode. Input strings are declared with the <span id="taintedstring_1">TaintedString</span> string type declared in the <code>system</code> module.</p> <p>If the taint mode is turned on (via the <code>--taintMode:on</code> command line option) it is a distinct string type which helps to detect input validation errors:</p> <pre class="listing" data-language="nim">echo "your name: "
var name: TaintedString = stdin.readline
# it is safe here to output the name without any input validation, so
# we simply convert `name` to string to make the compiler happy:
echo "hi, ", name.string</pre>
<p>If the taint mode is turned off, <code>TaintedString</code> is simply an alias for <code>string</code>. </p>
