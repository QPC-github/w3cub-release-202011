They can launch tasks synchronously or asynchronously.</p> <p>While you might run the main <code>/usr/bin/ansible</code> program for ad-hoc tasks, playbooks are more likely to be kept in source control and used to push out your configuration or assure the configurations of your remote systems are in spec.</p> <p>There are also some full sets of playbooks illustrating a lot of these techniques in the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ansible/ansible-examples">ansible-examples repository</a>. We’d recommend looking at these in another tab as you go along.</p> <p>There are also many jumping off points after you learn playbooks, so hop back to the documentation index after you’re done with this section.</p>   <h2 id="id2">Playbook Language Example</h2> <p id="playbook-language-example">Playbooks are expressed in YAML format (see <a class="reference internal" href="../reference_appendices/yamlsyntax#yaml-syntax"><span class="std std-ref">YAML Syntax</span></a>) and have a minimum of syntax, which intentionally tries to not be a programming language or script, but rather a model of a configuration or a process.</p> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="first admonition-title">Note</p> <p class="last">Some editors have add-ons that can help you write clean YAML syntax in your playbooks. See <a class="reference internal" href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/community/other_tools_and_programs.html#other-tools-and-programs"><span class="std std-ref">Other Tools And Programs</span></a> for details.</p> </div> <p>Each playbook is composed of one or more ‘plays’ in a list.</p> <p>The goal of a play is to map a group of hosts to some well defined roles, represented by things ansible calls tasks. At a basic level, a task is nothing more than a call to an ansible module.</p> <p>By composing a playbook of multiple ‘plays’, it is possible to orchestrate multi-machine deployments, running certain steps on all machines in the webservers group, then certain steps on the database server group, then more commands back on the webservers group, etc.</p> <p>“plays” are more or less a sports analogy. You can have quite a lot of plays that affect your systems to do different things. It’s not as if you were just defining one particular state or model, and you can run different plays at different times.</p> <p id="apache-playbook">For starters, here’s a playbook, <code>verify-apache.yml</code> that contains just one play:</p> <pre data-language="YAML">---
- hosts: webservers
  vars:
    http_port: 80
    max_clients: 200
  remote_user: root
  tasks:
  - name: ensure apache is at the latest version
    yum:
      name: httpd
      state: latest
  - name: write the apache config file
    template:
      src: /srv/httpd.j2
      dest: /etc/httpd.conf
    notify:
    - restart apache
  - name: ensure apache is running
    service:
      name: httpd
      state: started
  handlers:
    - name: restart apache
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: restarted
</pre> <p>Playbooks can contain multiple plays. You may have a playbook that targets first the web servers, and then the database servers. For example:</p> <pre data-language="YAML">---
- hosts: webservers
  remote_user: root

  tasks:
  - name: ensure apache is at the latest version
    yum:
      name: httpd
      state: latest
  - name: write the apache config file
    template:
      src: /srv/httpd.j2
      dest: /etc/httpd.conf

- hosts: databases
  remote_user: root

  tasks:
  - name: ensure postgresql is at the latest version
    yum:
      name: postgresql
      state: latest
  - name: ensure that postgresql is started
    service:
      name: postgresql
      state: started
</pre> <p>You can use this method to switch between the host group you’re targeting, the username logging into the remote servers, whether to sudo or not, and so forth. Plays, like tasks, run in the order specified in the playbook: top to bottom.</p> <p>Below, we’ll break down what the various features of the playbook language are.</p>   <h2 id="playbook-basics">Basics</h2>  <h3 id="playbook-hosts-and-users">Hosts and Users</h3> <p id="basics">For each play in a playbook, you get to choose which machines in your infrastructure to target and what remote user to complete the steps (called tasks) as.</p> <p>The <code>hosts</code> line is a list of one or more groups or host patterns, separated by colons, as described in the <a class="reference internal" href="intro_patterns#intro-patterns"><span class="std std-ref">Patterns: targeting hosts and groups</span></a> documentation. The <code>remote_user</code> is just the name of the user account:</p> <pre data-language="YAML">---
- hosts: webservers
  remote_user: root
</pre> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="first admonition-title">Note</p> <p class="last">The <code>remote_user</code> parameter was formerly called just <code>user</code>. It was renamed in Ansible 1.4 to make it more distinguishable from the <strong>user</strong> module (used to create users on remote systems).</p> </div> <p>Remote users can also be defined per task:</p> <pre data-language="YAML">---
- hosts: webservers
  remote_user: root
  tasks:
    - name: test connection
      ping:
      remote_user: yourname
</pre> <p>Support for running things as another user is also available (see <a class="reference internal" href="become#become"><span class="std std-ref">Understanding privilege escalation: become</span></a>):</p> <pre data-language="YAML">---
- hosts: webservers
  remote_user: yourname
  become: yes
</pre> <p>You can also use keyword <code>become</code> on a particular task instead of the whole play:</p> <pre data-language="YAML">---
- hosts: webservers
  remote_user: yourname
  tasks:
    - service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
      become: yes
      become_method: sudo
</pre> <p>You can also login as you, and then become a user different than root:</p> <pre data-language="YAML">---
- hosts: webservers
  remote_user: yourname
  become: yes
  become_user: postgres
</pre> <p>You can also use other privilege escalation methods, like su:</p> <pre data-language="YAML">---
- hosts: webservers
  remote_user: yourname
  become: yes
  become_method: su
</pre> <p>If you need to specify a password for sudo, run <code>ansible-playbook</code> with <code>--ask-become-pass</code> or <code>-K</code>. If you run a playbook utilizing <code>become</code> and the playbook seems to hang, it’s probably stuck at the privilege escalation prompt and can be stopped using <code>Control-C</code>, allowing you to re-execute the playbook adding the appropriate password.</p> <div class="admonition important"> <p class="first admonition-title">Important</p> <p class="last">When using <code>become_user</code> to a user other than root, the module arguments are briefly written into a random tempfile in <code>/tmp</code>. These are deleted immediately after the command is executed. This only occurs when changing privileges from a user like ‘bob’ to ‘timmy’, not when going from ‘bob’ to ‘root’, or logging in directly as ‘bob’ or ‘root’. If it concerns you that this data is briefly readable (not writable), avoid transferring unencrypted passwords with <code>become_user</code> set. In other cases, <code>/tmp</code> is not used and this does not come into play. Ansible also takes care to not log password parameters.</p> </div> <div class="versionadded" id="order"> <p><span class="versionmodified">New in version 2.4.</span></p> </div> <p>You can also control the order in which hosts are run. The default is to follow the order supplied by the inventory:</p> <pre data-language="YAML">- hosts: all
  order: sorted
  gather_facts: False
  tasks:
    - debug:
        var: inventory_hostname
</pre> <p>Possible values for order are:</p> <dl class="docutils"> <dt>inventory:</dt> <dd>The default. The order is ‘as provided’ by the inventory</dd> <dt>reverse_inventory:</dt> <dd>As the name implies, this reverses the order ‘as provided’ by the inventory</dd> <dt>sorted:</dt> <dd>Hosts are alphabetically sorted by name</dd> <dt>reverse_sorted:</dt> <dd>Hosts are sorted by name in reverse alphabetical order</dd> <dt>shuffle:</dt> <dd>Hosts are randomly ordered each run</dd> </dl>   <h3 id="id3">Tasks list</h3> <p id="tasks-list">Each play contains a list of tasks. Tasks are executed in order, one at a time, against all machines matched by the host pattern, before moving on to the next task. It is important to understand that, within a play, all hosts are going to get the same task directives. It is the purpose of a play to map a selection of hosts to tasks.</p> <p>When running the playbook, which runs top to bottom, hosts with failed tasks are taken out of the rotation for the entire playbook. If things fail, simply correct the playbook file and rerun.</p> <p>The goal of each task is to execute a module, with very specific arguments. Variables can be used in arguments to modules.</p> <p>Modules should be idempotent, that is, running a module multiple times in a sequence should have the same effect as running it just once. One way to achieve idempotency is to have a module check whether its desired final state has already been achieved, and if that state has been achieved, to exit without performing any actions. If all the modules a playbook uses are idempotent, then the playbook itself is likely to be idempotent, so re-running the playbook should be safe.</p> <p>The <strong>command</strong> and <strong>shell</strong> modules will typically rerun the same command again, which is totally ok if the command is something like <code>chmod</code> or <code>setsebool</code>, etc. Though there is a <code>creates</code> flag available which can be used to make these modules also idempotent.</p> <p>Every task should have a <code>name</code>, which is included in the output from running the playbook. This is human readable output, and so it is useful to provide good descriptions of each task step. If the name is not provided though, the string fed to ‘action’ will be used for output.</p> <p>Tasks can be declared using the legacy <code>action: module options</code> format, but it is recommended that you use the more conventional <code>module: options</code> format. This recommended format is used throughout the documentation, but you may encounter the older format in some playbooks.</p> <p>Here is what a basic task looks like. As with most modules, the service module takes <code>key=value</code> arguments:</p> <pre data-language="YAML">tasks:
  - name: make sure apache is running
    service:
      name: httpd
      state: started
</pre> <p>The <strong>command</strong> and <strong>shell</strong> modules are the only modules that just take a list of arguments and don’t use the <code>key=value</code> form. This makes them work as simply as you would expect:</p> <pre data-language="YAML">tasks:
  - name: enable selinux
    command: /sbin/setenforce 1
</pre> <p>The <strong>command</strong> and <strong>shell</strong> module care about return codes, so if you have a command whose successful exit code is not zero, you may wish to do this:</p> <pre data-language="YAML">tasks:
  - name: run this command and ignore the result
    shell: /usr/bin/somecommand || /bin/true
</pre> <p>Or this:</p> <pre data-language="YAML">tasks:
  - name: run this command and ignore the result
    shell: /usr/bin/somecommand
    ignore_errors: True
</pre> <p>If the action line is getting too long for comfort you can break it on a space and indent any continuation lines:</p> <pre data-language="YAML">tasks:
  - name: Copy ansible inventory file to client
    copy: src=/etc/ansible/hosts dest=/etc/ansible/hosts
            owner=root group=root mode=0644
</pre> <p>Variables can be used in action lines. Suppose you defined a variable called <code>vhost</code> in the <code>vars</code> section, you could do this:</p> <pre data-language="YAML">tasks:
  - name: create a virtual host file for {{ vhost }}
    template:
      src: somefile.j2
      dest: /etc/httpd/conf.d/{{ vhost }}
</pre> <p>Those same variables are usable in templates, which we’ll get to later.</p> <p>Now in a very basic playbook all the tasks will be listed directly in that play, though it will usually make more sense to break up tasks as described in <a class="reference internal" href="playbooks_reuse#playbooks-reuse"><span class="std std-ref">Creating Reusable Playbooks</span></a>.</p>    <h2 id="id4">Action Shorthand</h2> <div class="versionadded" id="action-shorthand"> <p><span class="versionmodified">New in version 0.8.</span></p> </div> <p>Ansible prefers listing modules like this:</p> <pre data-language="YAML">template:
    src: templates/foo.j2
    dest: /etc/foo.conf
</pre> <p>Early versions of Ansible used the following format, which still works:</p> <pre data-language="YAML">action: template src=templates/foo.j2 dest=/etc/foo.conf
</pre>   <h2 id="handlers">Handlers: Running Operations On Change</h2> <p id="handlers-running-operations-on-change">As we’ve mentioned, modules should be idempotent and can relay when they have made a change on the remote system. Playbooks recognize this and have a basic event system that can be used to respond to change.</p> <p>These ‘notify’ actions are triggered at the end of each block of tasks in a play, and will only be triggered once even if notified by multiple different tasks.</p> <p>For instance, multiple resources may indicate that apache needs to be restarted because they have changed a config file, but apache will only be bounced once to avoid unnecessary restarts.</p> <p>Here’s an example of restarting two services when the contents of a file change, but only if the file changes:</p> <pre data-language="YAML">- name: template configuration file
  template:
    src: template.j2
    dest: /etc/foo.conf
  notify:
     - restart memcached
     - restart apache
</pre> <p>The things listed in the <code>notify</code> section of a task are called handlers.</p> <p>Handlers are lists of tasks, not really any different from regular tasks, that are referenced by a globally unique name, and are notified by notifiers. If nothing notifies a handler, it will not run. Regardless of how many tasks notify a handler, it will run only once, after all of the tasks complete in a particular play.</p> <p>Here’s an example handlers section:</p> <pre data-language="YAML">handlers:
    - name: restart memcached
      service:
        name: memcached
        state: restarted
    - name: restart apache
      service:
        name: apache
        state: restarted
</pre> <p>You may want your Ansible handlers to use variables. For example, if the name of a service varies slightly by distribution, you want your output to show the exact name of the restarted service for each target machine. Avoid placing variables in the name of the handler. Since handler names are templated early on, Ansible may not have a value available for a handler name like this:</p> <pre data-language="YAML">handlers:
# this handler name may cause your play to fail!
- name: restart "{{ web_service_name }}"
</pre> <p>If the variable used in the handler name is not available, the entire play fails. Changing that variable mid-play <strong>will not</strong> result in newly created handler.</p> <p>Instead, place variables in the task parameters of your handler. You can load the values using <code>include_vars</code> like this:</p>  <pre data-language="yaml">tasks:
  - name: Set host variables based on distribution
    include_vars: "{{ ansible_facts.distribution }}.yml"

handlers:
  - name: restart web service
    service:
      name: "{{ web_service_name | default('httpd') }}"
      state: restarted
</pre>  <p>As of Ansible 2.2, handlers can also “listen” to generic topics, and tasks can notify those topics as follows:</p> <pre data-language="YAML">handlers:
    - name: restart memcached
      service:
        name: memcached
        state: restarted
      listen: "restart web services"
    - name: restart apache
      service:
        name: apache
        state: restarted
      listen: "restart web services"

tasks:
    - name: restart everything
      command: echo "this task will restart the web services"
      notify: "restart web services"
</pre> <p>This use makes it much easier to trigger multiple handlers. It also decouples handlers from their names, making it easier to share handlers among playbooks and roles (especially when using 3rd party roles from a shared source like Galaxy).</p> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="first admonition-title">Note</p> <ul class="last simple"> <li>Notify handlers are always run in the same order they are defined, <code>not</code> in the order listed in the notify-statement. This is also the case for handlers using <code>listen</code>.</li> <li>Handler names and <code>listen</code> topics live in a global namespace.</li> <li>Handler names are templatable and <code>listen</code> topics are not.</li> <li>Use unique handler names. If you trigger more than one handler with the same name, the first one(s) get overwritten. Only the last one defined will run.</li> <li>You cannot notify a handler that is defined inside of an include. As of Ansible 2.1, this does work, however the include must be <code>static</code>.</li> </ul> </div> <p>Roles are described later on, but it’s worthwhile to point out that:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>handlers notified within <code>pre_tasks</code>, <code>tasks</code>, and <code>post_tasks</code> sections are automatically flushed in the end of section where they were notified,</li> <li>handlers notified within <code>roles</code> section are automatically flushed in the end of <code>tasks</code> section, but before any <code>tasks</code> handlers,</li> <li>handlers are play scoped and as such can be used outside of the role they are defined in.</li> </ul> <p>If you ever want to flush all the handler commands immediately you can do this:</p> <pre data-language="YAML">tasks:
   - shell: some tasks go here
   - meta: flush_handlers
   - shell: some other tasks
</pre> <p>In the above example any queued up handlers would be processed early when the <code>meta</code> statement was reached. This is a bit of a niche case but can come in handy from time to time.</p>   <h2 id="id5">Executing A Playbook</h2> <p id="executing-a-playbook">Now that you’ve learned playbook syntax, how do you run a playbook? It’s simple. Let’s run a playbook using a parallelism level of 10:</p> <pre data-language="YAML">ansible-playbook playbook.yml -f 10
</pre>   <h2 id="playbook-ansible-pull">Ansible-Pull</h2> <p id="ansible-pull">Should you want to invert the architecture of Ansible, so that nodes check in to a central location, instead of pushing configuration out to them, you can.</p> <p>The <code>ansible-pull</code> is a small script that will checkout a repo of configuration instructions from git, and then run <code>ansible-playbook</code> against that content.</p> <p>Assuming you load balance your checkout location, <code>ansible-pull</code> scales essentially infinitely.</p> <p>Run <code>ansible-pull --help</code> for details.</p> <p>There’s also a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ansible/ansible-examples/blob/master/language_features/ansible_pull.yml">clever playbook</a> available to configure <code>ansible-pull</code> via a crontab from push mode.</p>   <h2 id="id6">Linting playbooks</h2> <p id="linting-playbooks">You can use <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-lint/index.html">ansible-lint</a> to run a detail check of your playbooks before you execute them.</p> <p>For example, if you run <code>ansible-lint</code> on the <a class="reference internal" href="#apache-playbook"><span class="std std-ref">verify-apache.yml playbook</span></a> introduced earlier in this section, you’ll get the following results:</p> <pre data-language="bash">$ ansible-lint verify-apache.yml
[403] Package installs should not use latest
verify-apache.yml:8
Task/Handler: ensure apache is at the latest version
</pre> <p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-lint/rules/default_rules.html">ansible-lint default rules</a> page describes each error. For <code>[403]</code>, the recommended fix is to change <code>state: latest</code> to <code>state: present</code> in the playbook.</p>   <h2 id="other-playbook-verification-options">Other playbook verification options</h2> <p>See <a class="reference internal" href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/community/other_tools_and_programs.html#validate-playbook-tools"><span class="std std-ref">Tools for Validating Playbooks</span></a> for a detailed list of tools you can use to verify your playbooks. Here are some others that you should consider:</p> <ul> <li>To check the syntax of a playbook, use <code>ansible-playbook</code> with the <code>--syntax-check</code> flag. This will run the playbook file through the parser to ensure its included files, roles, etc. have no syntax problems. </li> <li>Look at the bottom of the playbook execution for a summary of the nodes that were targeted and how they performed. General failures and fatal “unreachable” communication attempts are kept separate in the counts. </li> <li>If you ever want to see detailed output from successful modules as well as unsuccessful ones, use the <code>--verbose</code> flag.
