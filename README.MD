# W3cubDocs


## About

W3cubDocs combines multiple API documentations in a fast, organized, and searchable interface. This project is based on open source [devdocs](https://github.com/Thibaut/devdocs). we use jekyll system to rewrite this and hosted on Github Pages service.

Current project [W3cubDocs](http://docs.w3cub.com/), I must update it carefully, due to the Github project size limit. if sometime you can not view [current website](http://docs.w3cub.com), may be _updating_ or some other reasons. you can check the [devdocs](https://devdocs.io) project.
