<h1 id="label-Bug+Triaging+Guide">Bug Triaging Guide</h1> <p>This guide discusses recommendations for triaging bugs in Ruby's bug tracker.</p> <h2 id="label-Bugs+with+Reproducible+Examples">Bugs with Reproducible Examples</h2> <p>These are the best bug reports. First, consider whether the bug reported is actually an issue or if it is expected Ruby behavior. If it is expected Ruby behavior, update the issue with why the behavior is expected, and set the status to Rejected.</p> <p>If the bug reported appears to be an actual bug, try reproducing the bug with the master branch. If you are not able to reproduce the issue on the master branch, try reproducing it on the latest version for the branch the bug was reported on. If you cannot reproduce the issue in either case, update the issue stating you cannot reproduce the issue, ask the reporter if they can reproduce the issue with either the master branch or a later release, and set the status to Feedback.</p> <p>If you can reproduce the example with the master branch, try to figure out what is causing the issue. If you feel comfortable, try working on a patch for the issue, update the issue, and attach the patch. Try to figure out which committer should be assigned to the issue, and set them as the assignee, and set the status to Assigned.</p> <p>If you cannot reproduce the example with the master branch, but can reproduce the issue on the latest version for the branch, then it is likely the bug has already been fixed, but it has not been backported yet. Try to determine which commit fixed it, and update the issue noting that the issue has been fixed but not yet backported. If the Ruby version is in the security maintenance phase or no longer supported, change the status to Closed. This change can be made without adding a note to avoid spamming the mailing list.</p> <p>For issues that may require backwards incompatible changes or may benefit from general committer attention or discussion, consider adding them as agenda items for the next committer meeting (<a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14770">bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14770</a>).</p> <h2 id="label-Crash+Bugs+Without+Reproducers">Crash Bugs Without Reproducers</h2> <p>Many bugs reported have little more than a crash report, often with no way to reproduce the issue. These bugs are difficult to triage as they often do not contain enough information.</p> <p>For these bugs, if the Ruby version is the master branch or is the latest release for the branch and the branch is in normal maintenance phase, look at the backtrace and see if you can determine what could be causing the issue. If you can guess what could be causing the issue, see if you can put together a reproducible example (this is in general quite difficult). If you cannot guess what could be causing the issue, or cannot put together a reproducible example yourself, please ask the reporter to provide a reproducible example, and change the status to Feedback.</p> <p>If the Ruby version is no longer current (e.g. 2.5.0 when the latest version on the Ruby 2.5 branch is 2.5.5), add a note to the issue asking the reporter to try the latest Ruby version for the branch and report back, and change the status to Feedback. If the Ruby version is in the security maintenance phase or no longer supported, change the status to Closed. This change can be made without adding a note.</p> <h2 id="label-Crash+Bugs+With+3rd+Party+C+Extensions">Crash Bugs With 3rd Party C Extensions</h2> <p>If the crash happens inside a 3rd party C extension, try to figure out inside which C extension it happens, and add a note to the issue to report the issue to that C extension, and set the status to Third Party's Issue.</p> <h2 id="label-Non-Bug+reports">Non-Bug reports</h2> <p>Any issues in the bug tracker that are not reports of problems should have the tracker changed from Bug to either Feature (new features or performance improvements) or Misc. This change can be made without adding a note.</p> <h2 id="label-Stale+Issues">Stale Issues</h2> <p>There are many issues that are stale, with no updates in months or even years. For stale issues in Feedback state, where the feedback has not been received, you can change the status to Closed without adding a note. For stale issues in Assigned state, you can reach out to the assignee and see if they can update the issue. If the assignee is no longer an active committer, remove them as the assignee and change the status to Open.</p>
