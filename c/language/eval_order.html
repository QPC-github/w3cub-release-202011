<h1 id="firstHeading" class="firstHeading">Order of evaluation</h1>            <p>Order of evaluation of the operands of any C operator, including the order of evaluation of function arguments in a function-call expression, and the order of evaluation of the subexpressions within any expression is unspecified (except where noted below). The compiler will evaluate them in any order, and may choose another order when the same expression is evaluated again.</p>
<p>There is no concept of left-to-right or right-to-left evaluation in C, which is not to be confused with left-to-right and right-to-left associativity of operators: the expression <code>f1() + f2() + f3()</code> is parsed as <code>(f1() + f2()) + f3()</code> due to left-to-right associativity of operator+, but the function call to <code>f3</code> may be evaluated first, last, or between <code>f1()</code> or <code>f2()</code> at run time.</p>
<h3 id="Definitions">Definitions</h3> <h4 id="Evaluations">Evaluations</h4> <p>There are two kinds of evaluations performed by the compiler for each expression or subexpression (both of which are optional):</p>
<ul>
<li> <i>value computation</i>: calculation of the value that is returned by the expression. This may involve determination of the identity of the object (<a href="value_category" title="c/language/value category">lvalue evaluation</a>) or reading the value previously assigned to an object (rvalue evaluation) </li>
<li> <i>side effect</i>: access (read or write) to an object designated by a <a href="volatile" title="c/language/volatile">volatile</a> lvalue, modification (writing) to an object<span class="t-rev-inl t-since-c11"><span>, atomic synchronization</span> <span><span class="t-mark-rev t-since-c11">(since C11)</span></span></span>, modifying a file, modifying the floating-point environment (if supported), or calling a function that does any of those operations. </li>
</ul> <p>If no side effects are produced by an expression and the compiler can determine that the value is not used, the expression <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=c/language/as-if&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="c/language/as-if (page does not exist)">may not be evaluated</a>.</p>
<h4 id="Ordering">Ordering</h4> <p>"sequenced-before" is an asymmetric, transitive, pair-wise relationship between evaluations within the same thread (it may extend across threads if atomic types and memory barriers are involved).</p>
<ul><li> If a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_point" class="extiw" title="enwiki:Sequence point"><i>sequence point</i></a> is present between the subexpressions E1 and E2, then both value computation and side effects of E1 are <i>sequenced-before</i> every value computation and side effect of E2 </li></ul> <table class="t-rev-begin"> <tr class="t-rev t-since-c11">
<td> <ul>
<li> If evaluation A is sequenced before evaluation B, then evaluation of A will be complete before evaluation of B begins. </li>
<li> If A is not sequenced before B and B is sequenced before A, then evaluation of B will be complete before evaluation of A begins. </li>
<li> If A is not sequenced before B and B is not sequenced before A, then two possibilities exist: <ul>
<li> evaluations of A and B are unsequenced: they may be performed in any order and may overlap (within a single thread of execution, the compiler may interleave the CPU instructions that comprise A and B) </li>
<li> evaluations of A and B are indeterminably-sequenced: they may be performed in any order but may not overlap: either A will be complete before B, or B will be complete before A. The order may be the opposite the next time the same expression is evaluated. </li>
